 <h3>AACT 3.0.2 <i>(April 2, 2018)</i></h3>

  <h5>Publish Static Database Copy and Pipe-Delimited File Set Each Day</h5>
  <p>Until now, downloadable copies of the AACT database (a static copy and a set of 40 pipe-delimited flat files) have been created once a month and made available on the <a target='_blank' href='/download'>download page of the AACT website</a>. Several people have expressed interest in getting these downloadable versions more frequently. As of this release, a static copy of the database and a set of pipe-delimited files are created & published after each nightly load.</p>
  <p>To prevent the accumulation of hundreds of copies of the database through the year, these daily copies will be available for download only until the end of the month. Downloadable copies made on the first of the month will continue to be archived and made permanently available via the website. Both daily and monthly downloadable files can be retrieved from the <a target='_blank' href='/download'>download page of the AACT website</a>.</p>

  <p>(Prior to January, 2018, downloadable copies were created monthly, but not on the first. Going forward, these should be consistently created and dated on the first of each month.)</p>

  <h5>Publish the Database Update Schedule</h5>
  <p>A <a target='_blank' href='/update_policy'>page</a> displaying the schedule for updating the database has been added to the AACT website; it is accessible from a display card at the bottom of the <a target='_blank' href='/learn_more'>'Learn More' section</a> of the site</p>

  <h5>Retain History of Enumeration Ratios</h5>
  <p>Some table columns represent 'enumerations' of a fixed set of values. The AACT data dictionary presents row counts & the overall percent distribution for the values in enumeration columns. For example: on Februrary 28, 2018 the enumeration summary for Designs.primary_purpose was:</p>

  <section class="schema">
     <%= image_tag("sample_enumeration.png") %>
  </section>

  <p/>
  <p>We now retain a history of this information so that investigators will be able to see how these values trend over time. We also use this information to help verify the accuracy of each database update by comparing the percent distribution of each data element to its previous value. If any value changes more than 5%, an alert is sent to AACT administrators.</p>
