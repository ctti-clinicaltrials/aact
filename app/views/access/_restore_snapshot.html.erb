  <p>If you want to interact with the full dataset on your own machine, you can download one of the database snapshots from the above section. You'll need to use the pg_restore command line tool that comes with Postgres by running the following command:</p>

  <pre>
    <code>createdb -U yourusername databasename</code>
    <code>pg_restore -e -v -O -x -d databasename -U yourusername filename.dump</code>
  </pre>

  <p class="note">Note: this restore can take up to several hours depending on the speed of your machine.</p>
