    <h1>Download AACT</h1>
       <p>
       A static copy (snapshot) of the AACT database is created on the first of each month. The most recent and archived <a href='/snapshots'>snapshots</a> are available for download. These can be used to create a local copy of a particular instance of the database. A number of query and analytic tools (such as SAS, pgAdmin & R) can then be used to connect to and query your local copy.</p>
       <p>For those who prefer to access the data via simple flat files, each snapshot is also available as a <a href='/pipe_files'>zipped package of pipe-delimited files</a>.<p>
