    <h1>Connect to AACT</h1>
     <p>As a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database, AACT can be directly accessed via standard query & analytic tools. Several popular tools, such as pgAdmin and RStudio, are free and relatively easy to install and configure. Other proprietary tools are popular and provide powerful analytic and/or relational database utility; these tools include SAS, Toad, and Tableau. In many cases, access is a matter of installing the software package, configuring it to use PostgreSQL, and providing AACT connection credentials.
     </p>
     <p>Connecting directly is recommended for users who want to run analyses or queries using the most current, live data.</p>
