NCT05594173|Primary|Number of Chewing Cycles Per Bolus|Using surface electromyography (sEMG) of the masseter muscle, we will count the number of muscle contraction spikes (i.e. chewing cycles) seen for chewing activity for a single comfortable bite of each bolus type.|Baseline (single timepoint only)|Data for 3 additional participants could not be analyzed due to poor electromyography signal quality.|||number of chewing cycles||Standard Deviation|Mean
NCT05594173|Primary|Total Chewing Duration Per Bolus|Using surface electromyography (sEMG) of the masseter muscle, we will count the total duration of chewing activity for a single comfortable bite of each bolus type.|Baseline (single timepoint only)|Data for 3 additional participants could not be analyzed due to poor EMG signal quality.|||seconds||Standard Deviation|Mean
