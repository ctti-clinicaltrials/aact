      The purpose of this study is to observe the safety of agalsidase alfa in Canadian patients
      with Fabry disease.

      This study will evaluate the safety of agalsidase alfa in patients with Fabry disease.

      Patients diagnosed with Fabry disease who meet current Canadian guidelines for enzyme
      replacement therapy will be eligible to enroll in the study and will receive agalsidase alfa
      at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight administered by an IV infusion over 40 minutes every week
      or every other week, based on previous treatment.

      Shire has implemented a change to the drug substance manufacturing process. Safety data will
      be collected in patients receiving product manufactured with this process. There are no
      changes to the drug product formulation, manufacturing site, manufacturing process, and
      container closure.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in any phase of a clinical study, whether or not considered investigational product-related.Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as those events which occurred or worsened in severity after first treatment with Replagal AF until 30 days after the last dose. A serious AE (SAE) was any AE occurred at any dose that resulted in death, life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity and congenital anomaly or birth defect.</description>

    <description>An IRR (also referred to as infusion-related adverse event [IRAE]) was defined as an AE that began either during the infusion or within 12 hours after the start of the infusion and was judged as possibly or probably related to study drug. The IRRs were classified based on the severity as Mild=No limitation of usual activities, Moderate=Some limitation of usual activities, Severe=Inability to carry out usual activities and Life-threatening=Immediate risk of death.
