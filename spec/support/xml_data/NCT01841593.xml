      The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of an HIV medication (raltegravir) in the
      blood, and how it is affected if raltegravir is taken at the same time as another medicine
      for high blood pressure (amlodipine). Many patients with HIV will also have high blood
      pressure, so it is important to know which drugs for each of these conditions can be taken
      together without affecting how well they work individually.

      Over a 3 week period, participants took amlodipine for 2 weeks, and raltegravir for 2 weeks,
      with the middle week being on both drugs. The investigators will look at and compare the
      levels of these two drugs in the blood after subjects have taken them separately and both
      together.

      This study is randomised into two groups with both study medications received by all
      participants in a three-period crossover pattern; randomisation determined which medication
      was taken first. Once randomised allocation was performed, medications were administered in
      an open-label fashion.

      HIV-negative male and female volunteers will be enrolled, after written confirmation of
      informed consent, in a phase I, open-label, cross-over, PK study (approved by Westminster
      Research Ethics Committee and UK Regulatory Authorities; Eudra number 2012-005400-18).

      Subjects are randomized to receive either raltegravir 400mg twice-daily (seven days),
      followed by raltegravir 400mg twice-daily plus amlodipine 5mg once-daily (seven days),
      followed by amlodipine 5mg once-daily alone (seven days), or the same treatments in the
      opposite order, in the fasted state (at least eight hours) with 240mL of water.

      Intensive PK sampling and safety laboratory analysis are performed at the end of each phase
      (Days 7, 14 and 21). Raltegravir and amlodipine plasma concentrations will be analysed by a
      validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.

      PK parameters are determined by non-compartmental methods [WinNonlin Phoenix (version 6.1;
      Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, CA, USA]. These are the concentrations measured 12 and 24
      hours post-dose (C12h, C24h) for raltegravir and amlodipine, respectively; the maximum
      concentration (Cmax); and the area under the curve over 12 and 24 hours (AUC12h, AUC24h) for
      raltegravir and amlodipine, respectively.

    <description>To investigate the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir and amlodipine co-administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated for raltegravir and amlodipine will be trough concentration (Ctrough), defined as the concentration at 24 hours after the observed drug dose, the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), elimination half-life (t1/2), time point at Cmax (Tmax), and total drug exposure, expressed as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours after dosing (AUC0-24h).
All pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental modeling techniques (WinNonlin®) and all statistical calculations performed and analyzed using SAS version 9.1 or SPSS V17.0.</description>

        <title>Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Raltegravir and Amlodipine Without and With Co-administration of the Other Studied Drug.</title>
        <description>To investigate the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir and amlodipine co-administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated for raltegravir and amlodipine will be trough concentration (Ctrough), defined as the concentration at 24 hours after the observed drug dose, the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), elimination half-life (t1/2), time point at Cmax (Tmax), and total drug exposure, expressed as the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from 0–24 hours after dosing (AUC0–24h).
All pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental modeling techniques (WinNonlin®) and all statistical calculations performed and analyzed using SAS version 9.1 or SPSS V17.0.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 7 of each intervention (0 (pre-dose), 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours post dose (both drugs) and 24 hours post dose (amlodipine only))</time_frame>
