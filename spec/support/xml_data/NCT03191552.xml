  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder of development of movement and posture due to
      non-progressive lesion in fetal or infant brain. Postural control in children with cerebral
      palsy (CP) is deteriorated due to inappropriate muscle force and lack of sensory integration.
      The trunk which is found in the centre of the body plays a crucial role in postural control.
      Research and treatments in CP have focused on extremities rather than trunk control. Both
      evaluation and treatment of trunk impairment have not been adequately addressed in previously
      published studies. Improved proximal stability obtained by a better trunk control may lead to
      improvements in upper extremity function.

      Dynamic elastomeric fabric orthosis (DEFO) which are lycra based compression garments provide
      extra proprioceptive information which enhances body awareness. The more correct
      proprioceptive input result in the more proper alignment. Vest type dynamic elastomeric
      fabric orthosis (DEFO) is composed of a front part which is compromised of double-or
      triple-layer of lycra fabric attached to velcro sensitive neoprene back panel. Thus, it
      provides adjustable compression around the shoulder, trunk, pelvis, and hips. It is proposed
      that these orthotic garments provides stabilization of the trunk, shoulder and pelvis girdle
      and thus improve proximal stability and upper extremity function. Children with sensory
      deficits and poor muscle strength including children with neuromotor developmental disorders
      and hypotonia can benefit from the use of vest type dynamic elastomeric fabric orthosis.
      Severe restricted pulmonary function and refractory cyanosis are absolute contraindications
      for lycra based orthosis use while having severe reflux symptoms, uncontrolled epilepsy,
      cardiovascular circulatory disorders and being diagnosed with diabetes are relative
      contraindications. The adverse events pertaining to the use of these orthoses are difficulty
      in donning/doffing, toileting problems such as constipation and urinary leakage, decrease in
      respiratory function, heat and skin discomfort. Due to those unwanted effects, it can be
      assumed that longer wear time of the orthosis may lower compliance. However, the optimal wear
      time for vest type dynamic elastomeric fabric orthosis has not been established so far. The
      reported wear time of suit therapies range from 2 to12 hours a day during 2-12 weeks. The aim
      of this study was to investigate if the use of a vest type dynamic elastomeric fabric
      orthosis (DEFO) vest type dynamic elastomeric fabric orthosis is feasible or not and will
      lead to improvement in sitting balance, sitting as a gross motor function and gross manuel
      dexterity. The secondary purposes of the present study are to evaluate parent satisfaction
      with the orthosis and to compare 2 hours vs 6 hours of daily wear time.

    <description>Evaluates gross manuel dexterity. Box and Block Test which consists of a box divided into two compartments by a partition and blocks with standardized dimensions is used to assess unilateral gross manuel dexterity. The object is instructed to transport boxes one by one from one compertmant of the box to other in 60 seconds. The object should sit on a chair with a standard height and face the box. He/she should practice for a 15 second trial period before testing. If two blocks are carried at the same time, it is counted as one. And also if the block falls on the floor after it has been carried across, it is still counted. The score is the number of boxes transferred from one compartment to other in 60 seconds.</description>

Levels I-V based on self-initiated movement, with emphasis on sitting, transfers, and mobility. Level I is highest functioning, level V is lowest
General:
I: walks without limitations II: walks with limitations III: walks using hand-held mobility device IV: self-mobility with limitations; may use powered mobility V: transported in manual wheelchair</description>

        <description>Evaluates degree of achievement of sitting as a gross motor function. Gross Motor Function Measure sitting dimension is composed of 20 items. Each tem is scored according to special instructions on GMFM Manuel with a 4-point Likert scale including 0 = does not initiate, 1 = initiates, 2 = partially completes, 3 = completes. If it is not possible to test an item, it should be noted as not tested (NT) It assesses degree of achievement of gross motor functions rather than quality of them. Minimum score is 0 while maxium score is 60(3x20).</description>

        <description>Evaluates gross manuel dexterity. Box and Block Test which consists of a box divided into two compartments by a partition and blocks with standardized dimensions is used to assess unilateral gross manuel dexterity. The object is instructed to transport boxes one by one from one compertmant of the box to other in 60 seconds. The object should sit on a chair with a standard height and face the box. He/she should practice for a 15 second trial period before testing. If two blocks are carried at the same time, it is counted as one. And also if the block falls on the floor after it has been carried across, it is still counted. The score is the number of boxes transferred from one compartment to other in 60 seconds.</description>

        <description>Evaluates gross manuel dexterity. Box and Block Test which consists of a box divided into two compartments by a partition and blocks with standardized dimensions is used to assess unilateral gross manuel dexterity. The object is instructed to transport boxes one by one from one compertmant of the box to other in 60 seconds. The object should sit on a chair with a standard height and face the box. He/she should practice for a 15 second trial period before testing. If two blocks are carried at the same time, it is counted as one. And also if the block falls on the floor after it has been carried across, it is still counted. The score is the number of boxes transferred from one compartment to other in 60 seconds.</description>

        <description>A non-standardised 5-point Likert type scale was invented by the investigators to assess compliance and satisfaction with wearing orthosis. The parent satisfaction survey was measured on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 strongly agree and 5 strongly disagree to items of questionnaire below:
Parent satisfaction survey
SPIO vest was easy to put on/off.
Child was comfartable during times the SPIO was worn.
Child’s sitting balance improved.
Caring of the garment (cleaning vs) was easy.
Child’s confidence was improved.
No problems about touletting occured.
I wish to attend this therapy programme again.
I consider attending this therapy programme in the future again.
I consider to use SPIO vest for my child after the the therapy programme ended. Higher values representing better outcome. Items 3,5 and 7 is used to compare all groups (min 3-max 15) while the all of the items were used to compare the SPIO 2 hours and SPIO 6 hours (min 5-max 45).</description>
