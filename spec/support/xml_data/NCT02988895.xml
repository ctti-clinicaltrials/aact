  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, safety, usability and tolerability trial of
      Strontium 90 (Sr90) beta radiation episcleral brachytherapy in subjects receiving aflibercept
      therapy pro re nata (PRN) for the treatment of early neovascular Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (nAMD) lesions. Secondary aims are to observe clinical outcomes of area of
      leakage, sub-retinal fluid, lesion size, visual acuity, and anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (anti-VEGF) treatment burden.

      Subjects will receive a single brachytherapy treatment and 52-weeks of follow-up.
