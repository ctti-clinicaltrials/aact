  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OMNI study is to characterize therapy and diagnostic utilization in study
      participants implanted with study devices and to describe Implantable Cardioverter
      Defibrillator(ICD)therapy utilization for life threatening arrhythmias in primary and
      secondary prevention study participants. This study will assess therapies in Medtronic
      pacemaker, defibrillator, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices.

      The first therapy is for reducing unnecessary pacing in pacemaker patients. The second
      therapy provides pacing therapy in an attempt to stop fast or life threatening ventricular
      arrhythmias in lieu of delivering a defibrillation shock. The third therapy is a diagnostic
      measurement of a patient's fluid status and provides the physician information on the
      patient's heart failure status.

      The study will also assess the time to a patient's first defibrillation shock and will verify
      that the shock was for a fast or life threatening ventricular rhythm.

      The OMNI results demonstrate the importance of Medtronic's ongoing efforts to increase
      adoption of evidence based shock-reduction programming strategies. Longer VF NID (number of
      intervals to detect in the VF zone) should be utilized with the Anti-tachycardia Pacing (ATP)
      During Charging Feature. ATP during Charging allows physicians to treat with ATP without
      delay to shock. Therefore, VF NID may be extended to allow episodes the chance to
      self-terminate immediately to shock by use of the ATP during the charging feature.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>ICD/CRT-D baseline programming measurements, detection interval. Implanted Cardioverter/Defibrillator paces a patient's heart in a tachyarrhythmia prevention-pacing mode.
Detection intervals are used to detect atrial tachyarrhythmia. Detection Intervals are programmable heart rate thresholds. R-R intervals that are less than the VT or VF detection intervals (in ms) are considered evidence of VT or VF, respectively. R-R intervals that are between the FVT and the VF detection intervals are considered evidence of FVT. Thus, these detection interval thresholds demarcate rate zones of detection. The rate zones are used to determine the type of therapy applied once detection occurs.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study included 147 outpatient cardiology practices in the United States. Inclusion criteria were(1) implant of an implantable pulse generator (IPG), implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D); and (2) age 18 years or older. Enrollment period was from Aug 2005 to Jun 2006.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This is a post-market prospective study. No group assignment is given. Subjects implanted with IPGs were enrolled and followed at 6 and 12 months. Subjects implanted with ICDs or CRT-Ds were enrolled and followed at six, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Pacing mode is based on the NASPE/BPEG Generic (NBG) Pacemake coding which includes: I, the chambers paced (V= Ventricle, A=Atrium, D=Dual (A&amp;V), O=None); II, the chambers sensed (V= Ventricle, A=Atrium, D=Dual (A&amp;V), O=None); III, the mode of response (T=Triggered, I=Inhibited, D=Dual Triggered/Inhibited, O=None); IV, the programmable functions(R=Rate Modulated, C=Communicating, M=Multiprogrammable, P=Simple Programmable, O=None); V, the antitachycardia functions (O=None, P=Paced, S=Shocks, D=Dual (P&amp;S)). In addition, MVP (managed ventricular pacing) is a mode that promotes AV conduction by reducing or eliminating unnecessary RV pacing but maintains dual chamber ventricular support in the event that AV conduction is lost.</description>

        <title>Frequencies of Subjects With OptiVol Trends and Disease Progression.</title>
        <description>Estimate the correlation between OptiVol trends and disease progression.
A subject’s disease status was said to have progressed if:
The NYHA classification number increases (example: I to II), or
The LVEF decreases by at least 20% (relative difference) and by at least a 5% absolute difference, or
The subject expires
A subject who crossed OptiVol threshold since last visit was regarded as 'crossed threshold'.</description>

        <title>ICD/CRT-D Device Baseline Programming Measurements</title>
        <description>ICD/CRT-D baseline programming measurements, detection interval. Implanted Cardioverter/Defibrillator paces a patient's heart in a tachyarrhythmia prevention-pacing mode.
Detection intervals are used to detect atrial tachyarrhythmia. Detection Intervals are programmable heart rate thresholds. R-R intervals that are less than the VT or VF detection intervals (in ms) are considered evidence of VT or VF, respectively. R-R intervals that are between the FVT and the VF detection intervals are considered evidence of FVT. Thus, these detection interval thresholds demarcate rate zones of detection. The rate zones are used to determine the type of therapy applied once detection occurs.</description>
