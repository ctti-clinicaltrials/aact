    <textblock>
      A prospective multicenter imaging study for evaluation of chest pain. Objective is to
      determine whether an initial non-invasive anatomic imaging strategy with coronary CT
      angiography (CTA) will improve clinical outcomes in subjects with symptoms concerning for
      coronary artery disease relative to an initial functional testing strategy (usual care).
      Study hypothesis: initial anatomic testing strategy will provide information that will result
      in superior long-term health outcomes as compared to an initial functional testing strategy.

    <textblock>
      Pragmatic randomized trial of clinical effectiveness of diagnostic testing strategies for
      coronary artery disease (CAD), to be performed in outpatient settings including acute and
      primary care and cardiology offices. Qualifying patients presenting with new or worsening
      symptoms suspicious for clinically significant CAD who require diagnostic testing and have
      not been previously evaluated will be randomized to an initial strategy of either anatomic or
      functional testing. All subsequent decisions regarding additional testing, medications and/or
      procedures will be at the discretion of the responsible clinical care team Within the
      functional testing arm, the subject's care team will select the specific test to be performed
      (exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), stress nuclear, or stress echocardiogram (echo))
      consistent with 'usual care' in that practice setting. The subject's care team will be
      provided with 'Information sheets' summarizing current standards for test interpretation and
      preventive care, but specific medical treatment will not be mandated by the trial.

    <description>Participant score in Quality of Life as measured by Duke Activity Status Index (DASI). DASI measures a person's functional capacity based on a 12-item questionnaire that correlates with peak O2 uptake during exercise testing. The DASI is a self-administered questionnaire that measures a patient's functional capacity. It can be used to get a rough estimate of a patient's peak oxygen uptake. The maximum score for the DASI is 58.2 (better functional ability/capacity) and the minimum score is 0 (worse functional ability/capacity).</description>

SAQ: 19-item, 5-6-point Likert, questionnaire measuring 5 dimensions of coronary artery disease: Anginal Stability: whether symptoms are changing. Anginal Frequency: how often patient having symptoms Physical Limitation: how much condition hampers ability to do what he wants.Treatment Satisfaction: how well patient understands care. Disease Perception: impact of condition on interpersonal relationships. Each dimension assigns response an value, beginning with 1 for response at the lowest level of functioning &amp; summing across items within each of the 5 scales. Scale scores transformed to 0-100 range by subtracting the lowest scale. Higher score suggest symptoms more stable &amp; less frequent, condition has less impact on activities, increased satisfaction with treatment, &amp; perception of disease has less impact on interpersonal relationships.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life (QOL) as Measured by Duke Activity Status Index</title>
        <description>Participant score in Quality of Life as measured by Duke Activity Status Index (DASI). DASI measures a person's functional capacity based on a 12-item questionnaire that correlates with peak O2 uptake during exercise testing. The DASI is a self-administered questionnaire that measures a patient's functional capacity. It can be used to get a rough estimate of a patient's peak oxygen uptake. The maximum score for the DASI is 58.2 (better functional ability/capacity) and the minimum score is 0 (worse functional ability/capacity).</description>

SAQ: 19-item, 5-6-point Likert, questionnaire measuring 5 dimensions of coronary artery disease: Anginal Stability: whether symptoms are changing. Anginal Frequency: how often patient having symptoms Physical Limitation: how much condition hampers ability to do what he wants.Treatment Satisfaction: how well patient understands care. Disease Perception: impact of condition on interpersonal relationships. Each dimension assigns response an value, beginning with 1 for response at the lowest level of functioning &amp; summing across items within each of the 5 scales. Scale scores transformed to 0-100 range by subtracting the lowest scale. Higher score suggest symptoms more stable &amp; less frequent, condition has less impact on activities, increased satisfaction with treatment, &amp; perception of disease has less impact on interpersonal relationships.</description>
