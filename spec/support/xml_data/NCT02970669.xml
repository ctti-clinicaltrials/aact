  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of initiation of sacubitril/valsartan
      vs enalapril treatment on objective measures of both waking activity and sleep in subjects
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

    <description>Double blind treatment epoch: Patients randomized to this arm will receive 1 tablet of sacubitril/valsartan and 1 tablet of matching placebo enalapril twice daily for 8 weeks. All Patients will begin the study on Dose Level 1 (i.e. 24/26 mg sacubitril/valsartan BID). Patients may sequentially up-titrate to achieve desired dose of Dose Level 3 (i.e. 97/103 mg sacubitril/valsartan BID). Patients not tolerating dose escalation can be titrated down to next lower dose level.
Open-label treatment epoch: All patients entering this epoch (8 weeks) will be given sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg BID (Dose Level 2) unless they completed the double-blind treatment epoch on Dose Level 1. Instead, these patients will enter open-label epoch on Dose Level 1. Patients may sequentially up-titrate to achieve desired dose of Dose Level 3. Patients not tolerating dose escalation can be titrated down to next lower dose level.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          -  Men and women between 18 and 80 years of age

          -  Subjects diagnosed with NYHA class II or III heart failure and with reduced ejection
             (HFrEF).

        (Reduced ejection is defined as left ventricular EF ≤ 40%. LVEF ≤40% may be determined via
        any local measurement within the past 6 months prior to signing consent, using
        echocardiography, multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA), CT scanning, MRI or ventricular
        angiography provided no subsequent study documenting an EF of &gt;40%. If the EF measurement
        is expressed as a value range, the average of the range endpoint values should be used as
        the EF).

          -  Subjects must be a candidate for treatment with sacubitril/valsartan as per USPI.

          -  Subjects must be living in a traditional residence, apartment, or non-communal adult
             home where they can move about freely and frequently and are primarily responsible for
             scheduling their sleep and daily activities.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, including
             history of hypersensitivity to drugs of similar chemical classes, or allergy to ACEIs,
             ARBs, or NEP inhibitors as well as known or suspected contraindications to the study
             drugs.

          -  Subjects with a history of angioedema drug related or otherwise

          -  Subjects with symptomatic hypotension or systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg at
             screening or &lt;95 mmHg at randomization

          -  Subjects with any conditions in skin or upper extremities which would limit the
             ability to tolerate a wrist-worn actigraphy device on the non-dominant arm for 24
             hours/day for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who are non-ambulatory or use mobility assistive devices such as motorized
             devices, wheelchairs, or walkers. The use of canes for stability while ambulating is
             acceptable.

          -  Subjects with physical activity impairment primarily due to conditions other than
             heart failure such as:

          -  Exertional angina inflammatory or degenerative joint disease -gout

          -  peripheral vascular disease

          -  neurologic disease affecting activity or mobility
