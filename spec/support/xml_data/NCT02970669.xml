  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of initiation of
      sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril treatment on objective measures of both waking activity
      and sleep in subjects with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

    <description>Double blind treatment epoch: Patients randomized to this arm will receive 1 tablet of sacubitril/valsartan and 1 tablet of matching placebo enalapril twice daily for 8 weeks. All Patients will begin the study on Dose Level 1 (i.e. 24/26 mg sacubitril/valsartan BID). Patients may sequentially up-titrate to achieve desired dose of Dose Level 3 (i.e. 97/103 mg sacubitril/valsartan BID). Patients not tolerating dose escalation can be titrated down to next lower dose level.
Open-label treatment epoch: All patients entering this epoch (8 weeks) will be given sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg BID (Dose Level 2) unless they completed the double-blind treatment epoch on Dose Level 1. Instead, these patients will enter open-label epoch on Dose Level 1. Patients may sequentially up-titrate to achieve desired dose of Dose Level 3. Patients not tolerating dose escalation can be titrated down to next lower dose level.</description>

    <description>Double blind treatment epoch: Patients randomized to this arm will receive 1 tablet of enalapril and 1 tablet of matching placebo sacubitril/valsartan twice daily for 8 weeks. All Patients will begin the study on Dose Level 1 (i.e. 2.5 mg enalapril BID). Patients may sequentially up-titrate to achieve desired dose of Dose Level 3 (i.e. 10 mg enalapril BID). Patients not tolerating dose escalation can be titrated down to next lower dose level.
Open-label treatment epoch: All patients entering this epoch (8 weeks) will be given sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg BID (Dose Level 2) unless they completed the double-blind treatment epoch on enalapril Dose Level 1.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          -  Men and women between 18 and 80 years of age

             (HFrEF).

          -  Subjects must be a candidate for treatment with sacubitril/valsartan as per USPI.

          -  Subjects must be living in a traditional residence, apartment, or non-communal adult
             home where they can move about freely and frequently and are primarily responsible
             for scheduling their sleep and daily activities.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, including
             history of hypersensitivity to drugs of similar chemical classes, or allergy to
             ACEIs, ARBs, or NEP inhibitors as well as known or suspected contraindications to the
             study drugs.

          -  Subjects with a history of angioedema drug related or otherwise

          -  Subjects with symptomatic hypotension or systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg at
             screening or &lt;95 mmHg at randomization

          -  Subjects with any conditions in skin or upper extremities which would limit the
             ability to tolerate a wrist-worn actigraphy device on the non-dominant arm for 24
             hours/day for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who are non-ambulatory or use mobility assistive devices such as motorized
             devices, wheelchairs, or walkers. The use of canes for stability while ambulating is
             acceptable.

          -  Subjects with physical activity impairment primarily due to conditions other than
             heart failure such as:

          -  Exertional angina inflammatory or degenerative joint disease -gout

          -  peripheral vascular disease

          -  neurologic disease affecting activity or mobility
