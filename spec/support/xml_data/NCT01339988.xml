  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term follow-up studies have demonstrated significant late toxicities of total body
      irradiation (TBI), which are most marked in children radiated at a young age. Growth failure,
      decline in cognitive function, and endocrine abnormalities have all been described. Good
      outcomes can be achieved with alkylating agents only as a preparative regimen. This plan will
      use a combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy) with or without antithymocyte
      globulin (ATG) to reduce the late toxicities of therapy that includes TBI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suitable cord blood from matched unrelated or related donor.

          -  Cardiac (Echo/EKG): shortening fraction ≥ 27%

          -  Electrolytes within normal CCHMC limits.

          -  Pulmonary function tests: DLCO ≥ 50%

          -  Renal: creatinine clearance/GFR ≥ 60 ml/minute/1.73m2

          -  Lumbar puncture: no leukemic infiltrate.

          -  CBC: ANC ≥ 1000ml and unsupported platelet count of ≥ 50,000/ml

          -  Documented HSV and CMV titers, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C by serology,
             HIV by serology: all negative.

          -  Hepatic transaminases &lt; 2.5x normal; Total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl Patients who do not
             meet above organ function criteria (liver, cardiac, renal), due to the presence of a
             tumor compromising these organs, may have exception made for these criteria and remain
             eligible for treatment plan after consultation with Program Director of Blood and
             Marrow Transplant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neoplastic or non-neoplastic disease of any major organ system that
             would compromise their ability to withstand the pre-transplant conditioning regimen.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled (culture or biopsy positive) infections requiring
             intravenous antivirals, antibiotics, or antifungals. Patients on prolonged antifungal
             therapy with a history of fungal infection should be considered for a
             non-myeloablative protocol.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must
             practice an effective method of birth control while participating on this treatment
             plan.

          -  HIV seropositive patients
