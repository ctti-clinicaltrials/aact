  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of the vaccine induced immune
      responses at Month 48 (Year 4) and Month 60 (Year 5) in healthy subjects who received 3 doses
      of GSK Biologicals' candidate CMV vaccine according to a 0-1-6 month schedule during the
      primary study 108890 (NCT00435396) (vaccine group). The immune response to CMV infection in
      naturally infected subjects who participated in the screening visit of the primary study
      108890 (NCT00435396) and who were tested CMV-seropositive, will be used as a reference value
      (seropositive reference group). In addition, this study will continue to assess the
      occurrence of CMV infections as well as the continued development and validation of read-outs
      in the CMV project.

      The primary vaccination phase and Year 2 follow-up were posted as a separate protocol posting
      (NCT00435396).

      During the long-term follow-up study, all subjects who received 3 doses of GSK Biologicals'
      candidate CMV vaccine according to a 0-1-6 month schedule during the primary study 108890
      (NCT00435396) will be invited to participate at Visit 8 (Year 4) and Visit 9 (Year 5) as the
      vaccine group. In addition, the healthy subjects who participated in the screening visit of
      the primary study 108890 (NCT00435396) and who were tested CMV-seropositive will be invited
      to Visit 9 (Year 5) of this study as the seropositive reference group.This Protocol Posting
      has been updated following Protocol Amendment 1, March 2012, leading to the update of brief
      summary, intervention model, enrolment, outcome measures, eligibility and arms.

        For subjects in the vaccine group, the following exclusion criterion should be checked in
        addition:

        • Administration of any additional CMV vaccine since end of primary study 108890
