  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of increased circulating androgens on
      estradiol production by the granulosa cells in response to FSH stimulus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various previous studies have demonstrated that androgens enhance granulosa cell function in
      a variety of animal species including rodents and non-human primates. In vitro studies have
      shown that granulosa cells exposed to either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone exhibit
      increased production of estrogen, progesterone and inhibin in response to FSH. Studies done
      in non-human primates have also shown that androgen increases the numbers of preantral and
      antral follicles as well as increases FSH receptor mRNA expression in granulosa cells. This
      suggests that granulosa cell hyperresponsiveness to FSH in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
      may be related to androgen excess. The investigators plan to address this possibility by
      performing a series of in vivo studies. In one of the investigator's prior studies androgen
      blockade was done by administration of flutamide and E2 responses to FSH assessed. This
      study has been completed and the manuscript is being prepared for publication. In the
      present protocol, the investigators propose to further study the role of androgens with a 2
      phase study. In the first phase the investigators plan to suppress endogenous steroid
      hormone production by the ovaries via treatment with the GnRH analog Lupron for 4 weeks
      beyond which a gradual resumption of ovarian activity will occur. Granulosa cell (inhibin B)
      responses to FSH will be examined before and after ovarian suppression as well as during
      early and moderate recovery of ovarian steroidogenesis. These results will provide control
      data to which comparisons can be made from results of the next phase.

      In the second phase, after a 2 month washout interval, the same subjects will again receive
      Lupron to suppress endogenous steroid production. After 4 weeks, at the beginning of ovarian
      activity resumption, the investigators will administer Letrozole 5mg for 14 days and again
      examine granulosa cell responses to FSH during recovery. Letrozole is a 3rd generation
      aromatase inhibitor which results in suppression of E2 production and increase in
      circulating serum androgen levels to about 40% greater than pre-treatment values. It is now
      also being used for ovulation induction. It has minimal side effects and is in general very
      well tolerated. By using Letrozole for 2 weeks after GnRH suppression of the ovaries, the
      investigators will more effectively increase the amount of circulating androgen while
      keeping estrogen at low levels, thereby allowing the investigators to more completely study
      the effects of isolated and elevated androgen levels on granulosa cell responses to FSH. By
      comparing results obtained in phase 1, the investigators will be able to determine if there
      is an androgen mediated response by granulosa cells to FSH stimulation in the absence of
      other ovarian steroids. Also, the addition of a control group will allow investigators to
      determine if the granulosa cell response is different between PCOS and normals.

      It is hypothesized that there will be a significant rise in inhibin B production by the
      granulosa cells in PCOS women in response to FSH after treatment with Letrozole as compared
      to both the control group and to responses observed in the control phase of study. This
      would confirm that androgens are indeed responsible at least in part for the
      hyperresponsiveness to FSH seen in women with PCOS.

          <title>Phase I</title>
          <description>9 PCOS women will be studied. On study day one, r-FSH will be administered I.V. at a dose of 150 IU (FSH stimulation test). Blood samples will be obtained before and after FSH administration. After the FSH stimulation test, each subject will receive an I.M. injection of Lupron 3.75 mg. This dose has a duration effect of one month.
The FSH stimulation test will be repeated, as described above, at 5 weeks (early resumption of ovarian function) and 6 weeks (moderate resumption of ovarian function).</description>

          <title>Phase II</title>
          <description>Women that participated in Phase I will be studied again after a washout of 2 months. On study day one, an FSH stimulation test will be performed as described above.
After the FSH stimulation test, each subject will receive an I.M. injection of Lupron 3.75 mg. This dose has a duration effect of one month. Four weeks after administration of Lupron, each subject will receive Letrozole 5mg for 14 days. The FSH stimulation test will be repeated at 5 weeks (early resumption of ovarian function) and 6 weeks (moderate resumption of ovarian function).
Letrozole: In Phase II, letrozole, 5 mg/day, will be given for 14 days</description>
