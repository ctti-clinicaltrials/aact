      This phase II MATCH trial studies how well treatment that is directed by genetic testing
      works in patients with solid tumors or lymphomas that have progressed following at least one
      line of standard treatment or for which no agreed upon treatment approach exists. Genetic
      tests look at the unique genetic material (genes) of patients' tumor cells. Patients with
      genetic abnormalities (such as mutations, amplifications, or translocations) may benefit more
      from treatment which targets their tumor's particular genetic abnormality. Identifying these
      genetic abnormalities first may help doctors plan better treatment for patients with solid
      tumors, lymphomas, or multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment
      with targeted study agent in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple
      myeloma.

      II. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. III. To identify potential
      predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or
      resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and
      imaging-based assessment platforms.

      IV. To assess whether radiomic phenotypes obtained from pre-treatment imaging and changes
      from pre- through post-therapy imaging can predict objective response and progression free
      survival and to evaluate the association between pre-treatment radiomic phenotypes and
      targeted gene mutation patterns of tumor biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      STEP 0 (Screening): Patients undergo biopsy along with molecular characterization of the
      biopsy material for specific, pre-defined mutations, amplifications, or translocations of
      interest via tumor sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Consenting patients also undergo
      collection of blood samples for research purposes.

      STEPS 1, 3, 5, 7 (Treatment): Patients are assigned to 1 of 30 treatment subprotocols based
      on molecularly-defined subgroup. (See Arms Section)

      STEPS 2, 4, 6 (Screening): Patients experiencing disease progression on the prior Step
      treatment or who could not tolerate the assigned treatment undergo review of their previous
      biopsy results to determine if another treatment is available or undergo another biopsy.
      Patients may have a maximum of 2 screening biopsies and 2 treatments per biopsy.

      STEP 8 (Optional Research): Consenting patients undergo end-of-treatment biopsy and
      collection of blood samples for research purposes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.

    <measure>Objective response rate, defined as the percentage of patients whose tumors have a complete or partial response to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors, the Cheson (2014) criteria for lymphoma patients, and the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for glioblastoma patients. For each treatment arm, 80% two-sided confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Potential predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarkers measured prior to treatment could be predictive of response or non-response to the agent. Analyses conducted to identify predictive biomarkers will be primarily exploratory and will consist of simple comparisons of biomarkers levels, either using binomial-based tests (for binary biomarkers), t-tests (continuous biomarkers, possibly transformed), or non-parametric tests, as appropriate depending on the distribution of the biomarker values.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarkers that provide clues for mechanisms of acquired resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarkers measured at time of progression might provide clues for mechanisms of acquired resistance. Changes in biomarker levels from baseline (prior to receiving the treatment) to progression within patients will be assessed using paired tests appropriate for the type of biomarker measurement (e.g., paired t-tests for normally distributed biomarker values or McNemar tests for paired binary data). It will also be assessed whether patterns of changes in biomarkers are different depending on length of time to progression.</description>

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 4 months after completion of study;
             should a woman become pregnant or suspect while she or her partner is participating in
             this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Patients must have histologically documented solid tumors or histologically confirmed
             diagnosis of lymphoma or multiple myeloma requiring therapy and meet one of the
             following criteria:

               -  Patients must have progressed following at least one line of standard systemic
                  therapy and there must not be other approval/standard therapy available that has
                  been shown to prolong overall survival (i.e. in a randomized trial against
                  another standard treatment or by comparison to historical controls); patients who
                  cannot receive other standard therapy that has been shown to prolong overall
                  survival due to medical issues will be eligible, if other eligibility criteria
                  are met; if the patient is currently receiving therapy, the clinician must have
                  assessed that the current therapy is no longer benefitting the patient prior to
                  enrolling on MATCH, regardless of whether it is considered standard OR

               -  Patients for whose disease no standard treatment exists that has been shown to
                  prolong overall survival

               -  NOTE: No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately
                  treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer; in situ cervical cancer;
                  adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in
                  complete remission; any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free
                  for 5 years

          -  Patients must have measurable disease

          -  Patients must meet one of the following criteria:

               -  Patients must have tumor amenable to image guided or direct vision biopsy and be
                  willing and able to undergo a tumor biopsy for molecular profiling; patients with
                  multiple myeloma other than plasmacytomas are to have a bone marrow aspirate to
                  obtain tumor cells; biopsy must not be considered to be more than minimal risk to
                  the patient

                    -  NOTE: Registration to screening steps (Step 0, 2, 4, 6) must occur after
                       stopping prior therapy; there is no specific duration for which patients
                       must be off treatment prior to registration to the relevant screening step
                       (and subsequently, the biopsy), as long as all other eligibility criteria
                       are met OR

               -  Patient will be undergoing a procedure due to medical necessity during which the
                  tissue may be collected

                    -  NOTE: Registration to screening steps (Step 0, 2, 4, 6) must occur after
                       stopping prior therapy; there is no specific duration for which patients
                       must be off treatment prior to registration to the relevant screening step
                       (and subsequently, the biopsy), as long as all other eligibility criteria
                       are met OR

               -  Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block(s) are available for
                  submission following pre-registration (not applicable for bone marrow aspirate
                  specimens); criteria for the submission of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
                  (FFPE) tissue are:

                    -  Tissue must have been collected within 6 months prior to pre-registration to
                       Step 0

                         -  Patient may receive treatment after tissue collection; however, lack of
                            response must be documented prior to Step 1; the following restrictions
                            apply:

                              -  Enrollment onto another investigational study is not permitted

                              -  Intervening therapy that constitutes a new, molecularly targeted
                                 therapy is not permitted; please note, immunotherapy is not
                                 considered molecularly targeted

                                   -  Continuation of an agent/regimen for which disease
                                      progression has been observed prior to biopsy is permitted,
                                      including targeted therapy

                              -  A new immunotherapy regimen is permitted; but, lack of response
                                 must also be documented prior to registration to Step 0

                    -  Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block(s) must meet the minimum
                       requirements OR

               -  Results from one of the designated outside laboratories indicate a &quot;rare variant&quot;
                  that is an actionable mutation of interest (aMOI) for specific designated rare
                  variant subprotocols; the following requirements apply:

                    -  The outside laboratory notified the site that patient may be a potential
                       candidate for MATCH due to a detected &quot;rare variant&quot;

                    -  Patients with an applicable &quot;rare variant&quot; must be able to meet the
                       eligibility criteria for the appropriate subprotocols within 4 weeks
                       following entry on the EAY131 Step 0 screening step

                    -  Registration to Step 0 must occur after stopping prior systemic anti-cancer
                       therapy; there is no specific duration for which patients must be off
                       treatment prior to registration to Step 0, as long as all eligibility
                       criteria are met

                         -  NOTE: Other potential aMOIs that would be eligibility criteria for NON
                            RARE arms, as determined by the above laboratories, are not applicable
                            for direct treatment assignment on MATCH

                  indicated) until they receive notification of results; however, lack of response
                  must be documented prior to registration to Step 1; new non-protocol treatment
                  will NOT be permitted as intervening therapy after registration to Step 0; the
                  decision to stop the intervening non-protocol treatment will be left up to the
                  treating physician if patient has an aMOI; however, patients will need to be off
                  such therapy for at least 4 weeks before receiving any MATCH protocol treatment

               -  NOTE: For patients entering the study via a designated outside laboratory, no

                    -  Patient must not have hypokalemia (value &lt; institutional lower limit of
                       normal)

               -  No factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long
                  QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age or any concomitant
                  medication known to prolong the QT interval

                    -  NOTE: Patient must be taken off prohibited medication prior to registration
                       to the screening step (Step 0, 2, 4, 6) and remain off these medications
