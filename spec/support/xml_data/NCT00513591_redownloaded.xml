      It is difficult to predict how a women with an autoimmune disease will do during pregnancy.
      Some women will improve, others will worsen. Some pregnancies progress normally and others
      become very complicated.

      The Duke Autoimmunity in Pregnancy (DAP) Registry will enroll women with autoimmune
      diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and Sjogren's syndrome who wish
      to become, or already are, pregnant. We will follow these women throughout pregnancy to
      better understand how their autoimmune disease affects their pregnancy, and vice versa.

      Women with a systemic autoimmune disease that would be followed by a rheumatologist will be
      included in this study.

      All women will be seen every 4-6 weeks throughout pregnancy. At each visit, women will
      complete a questionnaire, the physician will determine the current level of disease
      activity, and a blood sample will be taken. For women with lupus and healthy women, and
      additional visit will occur at the start of the 3rd trimester for a closer evaluation of
      predictors of preterm birth.

      This is not an intervention study. Women will not be given experimental medication. All
      recommendations for treatment and monitoring will be made based on the best available data
      with input from the treating obstetrician.

      Women in this Registry are not required to be seen by Duke Obstetrics nor to deliver at a
      Duke Hospital.
