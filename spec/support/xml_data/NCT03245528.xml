        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be adults ≥ 18 years of age who remain hypotensive despite fluid therapy
             and vasopressor therapy and who received or are receiving a total sum norepinephrine
             (NE) equivalent unit dose of &gt; 0.2 µg/kg/min for at least 2 hours prior to LJPC-501
             infusion.

          -  Patients must have central venous access and an arterial line present, which is
             expected to remain for the duration of the LJPC-501 infusion.

          -  Patients must be adequately volume resuscitated in the opinion of the treating
             investigator.

          -  Patients must have clinical features of distributive shock documented by either
             estimated or measured CI &gt; 2.3 L/min/m^2 determined by echocardiogram or another
             cardiac output monitoring modality OR a concurrent CVP &gt; 8 mmHg and ScvO2 &gt; 70%.

          -  Patient or legal surrogate is willing and able to provide informed consent per local
             guidance and patient/legal surrogate is willing to comply with all protocol

          -  Patients in liver failure with a MELD score ≥ 30.

          -  Patients not mechanically ventilated with a history of asthma or who are currently
             experiencing bronchospasm requiring the use of inhaled bronchodilators.

          -  Patients with acute mesenteric ischemic or history of mesenteric ischemia.

          -  Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, systemic sclerosis, or vasospastic disease.

          -  Patients with an expected lifespan of &lt; 24 hours.

          -  Patients with active bleeding AND an anticipated need for transfusion of &gt; 4 units
             PRBCs within 48 hours of the initiation of LJPC-501.

          -  Patients with active bleeding AND hemoglobin &lt; 7 g/dL.

          -  Patients with an ANC &lt; 500 cells/mm^3.
