    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Expanded Access program is to provide margetuximab to patients with breast
      cancer and other HER2+ carcinomas who are not otherwise eligible for a MacroGenics sponsored
      study and the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of treatment use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MacroGenics will consider, on a case-by-case basis, requests by treating physicians to file a
      single patient investigational new drug application for expanded access to margetuximab and
      for MacroGenics to supply margetuximab for single patient use.
