    <textblock>
      People with HIV have a high chance of becoming infected with TB, especially when they live in
      areas where TB infection is common. It can be difficult to diagnose TB in people who need to
      start HIV treatment right away. Within about 6 months after starting HIV treatment, some of
      these people can become very sick with TB and can even die from it.

      This study is being done in people who are starting HIV treatment and who live in areas where
      the TB infection rate is high. The purpose of this study is to test an experimental approach
      to TB treatment to see if it is better than the usual approach. The experimental approach is
      to start TB treatment at the same time as HIV treatment, even when TB infection has not been
      found. The usual approach is to start TB treatment only if TB infection is found.

      In this study, half of the people will start TB treatment at the same time as they start
      their HIV treatment. The other half will start TB treatment only if TB infection is found.

      The study will also test how safe and effective it is to start TB treatment at about the same
      time as HIV treatment even when TB infection has not been found. The study will collect
      information about diet, whether (and when) people in the study become sicker or die, how well
      their HIV is controlled, how they are feeling, how they are taking their medications, whether
      it matters where they live or what kind of HIV and TB care is standard, how many people are
      diagnosed with TB while in the study, and how the cost of the two treatment options on a
      national level could be compared.

      This was a randomized, open-label, phase IV strategy trial for participants from
      resource-limited settings (RLS) who present with advanced HIV disease and no probable or
      confirmed tuberculosis (TB), as defined in the current ACTG diagnosis appendix, and who are
      initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) will be randomized to one of two strategy arms:
      immediate, empiric TB treatment (Empiric arm) or local standard of care TB treatment (IPT
      arm).

      Randomization was balanced by clinical trial unit and stratified according to CD4+ T cell
      count (&lt;25 vs. ≥25 cells/mm^3) and presence of any of the following prognostic factors:
      reportable hospitalization within the past 30 days, BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m^2, or anemia (hemoglobin
      &lt;8 g/dl).

      Participants are followed for 96 weeks. Participants attended study visits at screening,
      enrollment, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Signs and symptoms, ART modifications,
      concomitant medications, and clinical events as defined by AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
      Appendix 60 were collected at each visit. Blood was collected for CD4 and HIV-1 RNA at study
      entry, weeks 4 and 24 and blood for safety laboratories (liver function, hematology, and
      renal function) was collected at all visits except week 1. A sputum sample was collected and
      stored at study entry.

      The current results submission included data up to the primary outcome time point (week 24),
      and that after study completion, there will be a second results submission to include the
      data from the later visits up to week 96.

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the cumulative probability of death or unknown vital status by week 24.
Vital status at week 48 and again at weeks 60, 72, 84, and 96 was determined for participants who do not complete study follow-up, including those who are prematurely discontinued from the study before week 24 without coming in to the clinic. Vital status for participants who are not discontinued from the study whenever a scheduled visit of any type is missed was also obtained. The vital status was considered unknown at week 24 if a participant prematurely discontinued from the study before week 24 and no vital status was obtained at week 48.</description>

          <description>Study treatment for Arm A participants is the strategy of initiating study-provided or other FDA-approved or tentatively approved antiretroviral treatment as soon as possible following randomization and within no more than 3 days following randomization plus a 4-drug anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) regimen (defined as rifampin/isoniazid/ethambutol/pyrazinamide) as soon as possible following randomization and within no more than 7 days following initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After 2 months (or 8 weeks), the 4-drug ATT will be followed with 4 months (or 16 weeks) of 2-drug ATT (defined as rifampin/isoniazid). All participants will be followed through week 96.

        <title>Cumulative Probability of Death or Unknown Vital Status by Week 24</title>
        <description>The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the cumulative probability of death or unknown vital status by week 24.
Vital status at week 48 and again at weeks 60, 72, 84, and 96 was determined for participants who do not complete study follow-up, including those who are prematurely discontinued from the study before week 24 without coming in to the clinic. Vital status for participants who are not discontinued from the study whenever a scheduled visit of any type is missed was also obtained. The vital status was considered unknown at week 24 if a participant prematurely discontinued from the study before week 24 and no vital status was obtained at week 48.</description>

After 2 months (or 8 weeks), the 4-drug ATT will be followed with 4 months (or 16 weeks) of 2-drug ATT (defined as rifampin/isoniazid). All participants will be followed through week 96. Drug provision by or through the study will be through week 48 only</description>
