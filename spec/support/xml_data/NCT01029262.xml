  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lenalidomide would reduce the number of
      red blood cell transfusions (RBC) needed in anemic (RBC transfusion-dependent) participants
      with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS without a deletion 5q chromosome abnormality. The study
      also investigated the safety of lenalidomide use in these participants. Two-thirds of the
      participants received oral lenalidomide and one-third of the participants received oral
      placebo.

    <description>A participant was considered as having achieved an erythroid response if the participant either:
- had a hemoglobin (Hgb) increase ≥1.5 g/dL compared to baseline and confirmed by another central laboratory hemoglobin value at 4 to 8 weeks after the first Hgb measurement that also increased ≥1.5 g/dL. All Hgb values during this time interval must have had a ≥ 1.5 g/dL increase (ie, no central laboratory Hgb increase during this timeframe could be less &lt;1.5 g/dL). The duration of Hgb increase is from the date of a first ≥1.5 g/dL increase to the last date when Hgb value still have a ≥1.5 g/dL increase.
OR
- had a 50% reduction in the number of the RBC transfusion units over any consecutive 56 days period compared to the baseline transfusion burden.
The baseline transfusion burden is the number of units over 112 days by the randomization divided by 2. Only transfusions given for a pre-transfusion Hgb value of 9 g/dL or less may be used in this response assessment.</description>

    <description>A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;
Life-threatening event;
Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event
The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 3.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death.</description>

    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher score on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. A participant was considered compliant at a visit if at least 15 out of the QLQ-C30 items in the questionnaire were checked.</description>

          <title>International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) Investigator determined</title>
          <description>The Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) IPSS score assesses the severity of MDS based on 3 prognostic factors each assigned a score: the percentage of bone marrow blasts, chromosome changes in the marrow cells (karyotype) and the presence of one or more low blood cell counts (cytopenias). The IPSS score is the sum of the bone marrow blast + karyotype + cytopenia score and ranges from 0 (low risk) to 3.5 (high risk). Prognosis is categorized as Low risk (score = 0), Intermediate-1 (score 0.5 to 1.0), Intermediate-2 (score 1.5 to 2.0) or High risk (score ≥ 2.5).</description>

          <description>Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) are similar to the cytokine (erythropoietin) that stimulates red blood cell production (erythropoieisis). ESAs, structurally and biologically, are similar to naturally occurring protein erythropoietin.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Erythroid Response Based on Modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 Criteria</title>
        <description>A participant was considered as having achieved an erythroid response if the participant either:
- had a hemoglobin (Hgb) increase ≥1.5 g/dL compared to baseline and confirmed by another central laboratory hemoglobin value at 4 to 8 weeks after the first Hgb measurement that also increased ≥1.5 g/dL. All Hgb values during this time interval must have had a ≥ 1.5 g/dL increase (ie, no central laboratory Hgb increase during this timeframe could be less &lt;1.5 g/dL). The duration of Hgb increase is from the date of a first ≥1.5 g/dL increase to the last date when Hgb value still have a ≥1.5 g/dL increase.
OR
- had a 50% reduction in the number of the RBC transfusion units over any consecutive 56 days period compared to the baseline transfusion burden.
The baseline transfusion burden is the number of units over 112 days by the randomization divided by 2. Only transfusions given for a pre-transfusion Hgb value of 9 g/dL or less may be used in this response assessment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;
Life-threatening event;
Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event
The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 3.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
          <description>A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;
Life-threatening event;
Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event
The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event. The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 3.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death.</description>

        <title>Compliance Rates Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) From Baseline to Week 48</title>
        <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher score on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. A participant was considered compliant at a visit if at least 15 out of the QLQ-C30 items in the questionnaire were checked.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, (±3 days), Week 24, (±3 days), Week 36, (±3 days), and Week 48 (±3 days); up to data cut-off of 17 Mar 2014</time_frame>
        <population>Analyses were performed based on the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) evaluable population, defined as all randomized participants who completed the baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment for the intent to treat population. Data is available up to Week 48 due to small sample after that.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue Domain at Week 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).
The EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue Scale is scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating a higher level of symptoms. Negative change from Baseline values indicate reduction in fatigue (i.e. improvement in symptom) and positive values indicate increases in fatigue (i.e. worsening of symptom).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12, ±3 days and Week 24, ±3 days</time_frame>
        <population>Analyses were performed based on the HRQoL evaluable population, defined as all randomized participants who completed the baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment for the intent to treat population. Only those with available data at baseline and each time point (indicated by &quot;n&quot;) are included.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Domain at Week 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).
The EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Scale was scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating better functioning. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Fatigue Domain Associated With the EORTC QLQ-C-30 Scale at Week 12 and Week 24</title>
        <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue Scale is scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating a higher level of symptoms. Negative change from Baseline values indicate reduction in fatigue (i.e. improvement in symptom) and positive values indicate increases in fatigue (i.e. worsening of symptom).</description>

        <population>Analyses were performed based on the HRQoL evaluable population, defined as all randomized participants who completed the baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment for the intent to treat population.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Global Health Status/QoL Domain Associated With the EORTC QLQ-C-30 Scale at Week 12 and Week 24</title>
        <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/QOL scale was scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating better Global Health Status/QOL. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in Global Health Status/QOL and positive values indicate improvement.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Meaningful Improvement in HRQOL Associated With the EORTC QLQ-C-30 Scale From Baseline in the Dyspnea Domain at Weeks 12 and 24</title>
          <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).
The EORTC QLQ-C30 Dyspnea scale is scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating a higher level of symptoms. Negative change from Baseline values indicate decreased dyspnea (i.e. improvement in symptom) and positive values indicate increased dyspnea (i.e. worsening of symptom). Improvement means at least 10 points better compared to baseline.</description>

        <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) was a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It contains 30 questions, 24 of which form 9 multi-item scales representing various aspects of HRQOL: 1 global scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Emotional, Cognitive and Social), and 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea). The remaining 6 items are intended to be mono-item scales describing relevant cancer-oriented symptoms (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher score on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. A change of at least 10 points on the standardized domain scores was required for it to be considered clinically meaningful.</description>

It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).
The EORTC QLQ-C30 Emotional Functioning Domain was scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating better functioning. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in functioning and positive values indicate improvement.</description>
          <population>Analyses were performed based on the HRQoL evaluable population, defined as all randomized participants who completed the baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment for the intent to treat population. Only those with available data at baseline and each time point (indicated by &quot;n&quot; ) are included.</population>
