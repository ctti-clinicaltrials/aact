  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of multiple immunotherapy-based treatment combinations in patients with
      metastatic or inoperable locally advanced TNBC who had disease progression during or
      following first-line metastatic treatment with chemotherapy.

      The study will be performed in two stages. During Stage 1, participants will be randomized to
      capecitabine (control) or an atezolizumab-containing doublet or triplet combination. Those
      who experience disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity may be
      eligible to receive a new doublet combination treatment in Stage 2 until loss of clinical
      benefit or unacceptable toxicity. New treatment arms may be added and/or existing treatment
      arms may be closed during the course of the study on the basis of ongoing clinical efficacy
      and safety as well as the current treatments available.
