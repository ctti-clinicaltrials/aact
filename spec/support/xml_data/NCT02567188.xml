      An observational, longitudinal, multi-center, non-interventional study in participants with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-4, assessed by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
      (MDRD) to collect data regarding safety and efficacy in participants with pre-dialysis
      situation who are treated with MIRCERA in normal clinical environment.
