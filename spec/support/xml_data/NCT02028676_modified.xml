      The two original objectives were to determine in HIV-infected children initiating
      antiretroviral therapy (ART):

        1. Whether clinically driven monitoring (CDM) will have a similar outcome in terms of
           disease progression or death as routine laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM) for
           toxicity (haematology/biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4)?

        2. Whether induction with four drugs from two ART classes followed by maintenance with
           three drugs after 36 weeks be more effective than a continuous non-nucleoside reverse
           transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-based triple drug regimen in terms of CD4 and clinical
           outcome?

           Two secondary objectives were to determine

        3. Whether changing from twice daily lamivudine+abacavir to once daily lamivudine+abacavir
           after 48 weeks on ART will have a similar outcome in terms of virological suppression
           and will result in improvements in adherence to ART?

        4. Whether stopping daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in children over 3 years of age who
           have been on ART for at least 96 weeks has a similar outcome in terms of
           hospitalisation or death as continuing daily cotrimoxazole?

      The ARROW (AntiRetroviral Research fOr Watoto) protocol describes an open-label randomised
      trial primarily evaluating two strategic approaches for management of antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) in 1200 symptomatic HIV-infected infants and children initiating ART following WHO
      guidelines in Uganda and Zimbabwe. The first strategy compares clinically driven monitoring
      (CDM) with laboratory plus clinical monitoring (LCM). In both groups, tests for toxicity
      (standard haematology and biochemistry panels) and efficacy (lymphocyte subsets including
      CD4 count) will be done every 12 weeks. In LCM, all results will be returned for patient
      management. In CDM, physicians may request results from routine haematology/biochemistry
      panels if needed for clinical management, but results will not be returned routinely, and
      lymphocyte subsets will never be returned. Extra laboratory tests may be requested outside
      of the scheduled visits at any time in either group (except for lymphocyte subsets in CDM).
      The second strategy compares a continuous WHO-recommended first-line ART three-drug
      two-class regimen, comprising two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) plus
      one Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), with induction with four drugs
      (two classes) for 36 weeks followed by maintenance with three drugs. After at least 36 and
      96 weeks on ART respectively, two further randomisations will assess simplification
      strategies which could improve long-term ART adherence (i) once versus twice daily
      lamivudine+abacavir NRTI drugs (ii) stopping versus continuing daily cotrimoxazole
      prophylaxis.

Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        For initial randomisation to CDM vs LCM, and to ART induction strategy:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children should have an adult carer in the household who is either:

               -  participating in the DART trial OR

               -  being treated with ART OR

               -  HIV positive but not yet needing treatment but with access to a treatment
                  programme when ART is required OR

               -  HIV negative. Children of DART participants should have first priority on any
                  available remaining slots to enter ARROW.

          2. Parents or guardians, and children where appropriate according to age and knowledge
             of HIV status, must be willing and able to give informed consent for randomisation to
             CDM or LCM and to first-line ART strategy.

          3. Participants must have a confirmed documented diagnosis of HIV-1 infection:

               1. For children aged under 18 months: two separate peripheral blood specimens from
                  different days, both results being positive with HIV-DNA polymerase chain
                  reaction (PCR).

               2. For children aged 18 months or over: antibody positive serology by ELISA test
                  (confirmed by licensed second ELISA or Western Blot) or WHO approved rapid test
                  (performed in series) both on the same sample. Any child previously tested at
                  another clinic should have a repeat test at an ARROW screening laboratory to
                  confirm their status.

          4. Age 3 months to 17 years (13-17 years to be capped at 10%)

          5. ART naïve (except for exposure to perinatal ART for the prevention of mother-to-child
             HIV transmission).

          6. Meeting criteria for requiring ART according to WHO stage and CD4 percent or count:

               -  WHO paediatric clinical stage IV disease: treat regardless of CD4 percent or
                  count

               -  WHO paediatric clinical stage III disease:

                    -  &lt;12 months: treat all

                    -  &gt;12 months: treat all children irrespective of the CD4 percent or count;
                       however, in children aged &gt; 12 months with tuberculosis, lymphocytic
                       interstitial pneumonia (LIP), oral hairy leukoplakia (OHP) or
                       thrombocytopenia (low platelet count treat) be guided by CD4 cell assays
                       (see below).

               -  WHO paediatric clinical stage II or I disease: treat guided by CD4 percent or
                  count

                    -  CD4%&lt;25% for infants &lt;12 months;

                    -  CD4%&lt;20% for children 1-&lt;3 years;

                    -  CD4% &lt;15% for children 3-&lt;5years;

                    -  CD4% &lt;15% for children &gt; 5years (consideration should also be taken of the
                       CD4 count. A CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm3 can be used to guide starting ART and
                       CD4 should generally be &lt;350 cells/mm3.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cannot, or unlikely to attend regularly (e.g. usual residence too far from study
             centre)

          2. Likelihood of poor adherence

          3. Presence of acute infection (e.g. malaria, helminthiasis, acute hepatitis, acute
             pneumonia, septicaemia, meningitis). Children may be admitted after recovery of an
             acute infection. Children with chronic lung disease, including recurrent respiratory
             infections, are eligible. Children with tuberculosis (TB) will not be enrolled while
             on the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis therapy, but should be re-evaluated after
             the intensive phase and a decision made then about starting ART (see 4 below)

          4. In receipt of medication contraindicated by ART

               -  children under three years of age receiving anti-tuberculosis therapy should not
                  be enrolled (as they will have to receive nevirapine).

               -  on chemotherapy for malignancy

          5. Laboratory abnormalities which are a contra-indication for the child to start ART
             (haemoglobin &lt;8.5g/dL; neutrophils &lt;0.50x109/L; aspartate transaminase (AST) or
             alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); grade 3 renal
             dysfunction - creatinine &gt;1.9 x ULN).

             N.B. causes of anaemia, such as concurrent bacterial infection, malaria,
             helminthiasis and/or malnutrition should be investigated, and treatment for anaemia
             and its causes commenced prior to re-screening for eligibility.

          6. Being pregnant or breast-feeding an infant

          7. Perinatal exposure to nevirapine (either through prevention of mother-to-child
             transmission (pMTCT) or breastfeeding) for children aged 3 - 6 months only

        Eligibility criteria for the secondary randomisation to once vs twice daily
        lamivudine+abacavir Inclusion criteria

          1. Participating in ARROW

          2. On ART for at least 36 weeks

          3. Currently taking lamivudine+abacavir twice daily as part of their ART regimen and
             expected to stay on these two drugs for at least the next 12 weeks

          4. Parents or guardians, and children where appropriate according to age and knowledge
             of HIV status, must be willing and able to give informed consent for randomisation to

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>All recruited children (n=1206) were randomly assigned to CDM vs LCM and the three different induction ART strategies at enrolment (3/2007-11/2008). This was a factorial randomisation meaning that the children were effectively randomized into 6 parallel groups. Baseline characteristics are presented below separately for each initial randomization.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There were two additional nested substudy randomizations after initial trial enrolment (see inclusion/exclusion criteria for eligibility). From 8/2009 to 6/2010, eligible children were randomized to once vs twice daily abacavir+lamivudine. From 9/2009 to 2/2011, eligible children were randomized to stop vs continue cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Clinically Driven Monitoring (CDM): Participants were examined by a doctor and had routine full blood count with white cell differential, lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8), biochemistry tests (bilirubin, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) at screening, randomisation (lymphocytes only), weeks 4, 8, and 12, then every 12 weeks. Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

          <description>Clinically Driven Monitoring (CDM): Participants were examined by a doctor and had routine full blood count with white cell differential, lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8), biochemistry tests (bilirubin, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) at screening, randomisation (lymphocytes only), weeks 4, 8, and 12, then every 12 weeks. Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

            <description>Participants were examined by a doctor and had routine full blood count with white cell differential, lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8), biochemistry tests (bilirubin, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) at screening, randomisation (lymphocytes only), weeks 4, 8, and 12, then every 12 weeks. Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

            <description>Participants were examined by a doctor and had routine full blood count with white cell differential, lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8), biochemistry tests (bilirubin, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) at screening, randomisation (lymphocytes only), weeks 4, 8, and 12, then every 12 weeks. Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results at and after randomisation were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>

Screening results were used to assess eligibility. All subsequent results were only returned if requested for clinical management (authorised by centre project leaders); haemoglobin results at week 8 were automatically returned on the basis of early anaemia in a previous adult trial as were grade 4 laboratory toxicities (protocol safety criteria). Total lymphocytes and CD4 tests were never returned for CDM participants, but for all children other investigations (including tests from the routine panels) could be requested and concomitant drugs prescribed, as clinically indicated at extra patient-initiated or scheduled visits.</description>
