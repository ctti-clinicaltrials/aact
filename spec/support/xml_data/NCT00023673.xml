      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells
      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them with
      specialized radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the effectiveness of radiation therapy combined
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients who have stage III non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when
           administered concurrently with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with inoperable
           stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I) (Closed to accrual as of
           01/13/04.)

        -  Determine the 12-month survival rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)
           (Closed to accrual as of 11/27/07.)

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the partial organ tolerance doses for the lung and esophagus in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of 3-dimensional conformal
      radiotherapy.

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 01/13/04): Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy once daily five days a week for 7-8 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent
           chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.

      Cohorts of 7-9 patients receive de-escalating doses of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined when given in combination with
      chemotherapy. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 patient
      experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Additional patients are accrued and treated as above at the MTD. At least 3
           weeks after completing radiotherapy, patients may receive additional chemotherapy
           comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours once and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once.
           Treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin may repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 3-5 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 73 patients (up to 27 for phase I [closed to accrual as of
      10/28/04] and 46 for phase II) will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5 years.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Three-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3DRT), in Terms of Gy Per Fraction, Combined With Concurrent Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) = Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities (excluding nausea, vomiting, and alopecia) and Grade 4 hematologic toxicities. The DLT rate for this study was set at 40% based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study 94-10. No acute (within 90 days from start of 3DRT) DLT's in the first 5 patients (0/5) or the combination of one acute DLT in the first 5 patients (1/5) and none in the next 2 patients (0/2) was required to deem a given dose level to be acceptable. If at any time a Grade 5 toxicity (death) occurred, accrual would be suspended and the event reviewed by a study chair. At any given dose level, this design gives at least 90% confidence that the true acute DLT rate is less than 40% and the probability of not escalating when the true toxicity rate is 40% or higher is at least 83%.
Rating scale: 0 = not the MTD, 1 = MTD</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Survive at Least 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Null hypothesis: p&lt;= 62.3% (the best arm of RTOG 94-10); alternative hypothesis: p&gt;= 77.9%. Where p is the percentage of patients alive at at 12 months. Using a one-group chi-square test with alpha = 0.10, a sample size of 50 patients provides at least 87% power to detect a 25% or greater relative increase in the 12-month survival rate, or equivalently, an absolute increase of at least 15.6 percentage points (62.3 versus 77.9). If the point estimate is greater than 71.1% (upper bound), then the conclusion is that the 12-month survival rate from the new treatment significantly improved from 62.3%.</description>

    <description>Highest grade toxicity per subject was counted. Toxicities were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) v 2.0 for chemotherapy/acute RT toxicities and using the RTOG/EORTC Late Toxicity Criteria for late RT toxicity. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. Both criteria assign Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for a given toxicity based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to toxicity.Chemotherapy/Acute RT toxicities occur during chemotherapy and/or within 90 days of the start of RT. Late RT toxicities occur more than 90 days after the start of RT.</description>

    <description>Percent volume of total lung receiving &gt; 20 Gy radiation therapy (Lung V20) was compared between the two patient groups of those who experienced a grade 3 and higher lung toxicity and those who did not. Similarly, it was also compared between the two patient groups of those who experienced a grade 2 and higher esophageal toxicity and those who did not. Toxicities graded using CTC v 2.0 for chemotherapy/acute RT toxicities and using the RTOG/EORTC Late Toxicity Criteria for late RT toxicity. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. Both criteria assign Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for a given toxicity based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to toxicity.</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Three-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3DRT), in Terms of Gy Per Fraction, Combined With Concurrent Chemotherapy</title>
        <description>Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) = Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities (excluding nausea, vomiting, and alopecia) and Grade 4 hematologic toxicities. The DLT rate for this study was set at 40% based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study 94-10. No acute (within 90 days from start of 3DRT) DLT's in the first 5 patients (0/5) or the combination of one acute DLT in the first 5 patients (1/5) and none in the next 2 patients (0/2) was required to deem a given dose level to be acceptable. If at any time a Grade 5 toxicity (death) occurred, accrual would be suspended and the event reviewed by a study chair. At any given dose level, this design gives at least 90% confidence that the true acute DLT rate is less than 40% and the probability of not escalating when the true toxicity rate is 40% or higher is at least 83%.

        <description>Percent volume of total lung receiving &gt; 20 Gy radiation therapy (Lung V20) was compared between the two patient groups of those who experienced a grade 3 and higher lung toxicity and those who did not. Similarly, it was also compared between the two patient groups of those who experienced a grade 2 and higher esophageal toxicity and those who did not. Toxicities graded using CTC v 2.0 for chemotherapy/acute RT toxicities and using the RTOG/EORTC Late Toxicity Criteria for late RT toxicity. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. Both criteria assign Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for a given toxicity based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to toxicity.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was originally designed to escalate 3DRT via increasing doses per fraction. However, due to excessive toxicity at dose level 1 (75.25 Gy, 2.15 Gy/fraction), the protocol was amended in January 2003 to de-escalate 3DRT dose.</limitations_and_caveats>
