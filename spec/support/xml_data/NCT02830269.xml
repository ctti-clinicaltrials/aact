      Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is usually used in the evaluation and management of
      patients with brain injury. This noninvasive method measures local blood flow velocity and
      direction in the proximal portions of large intracranial arteries. The operator requires a
      short training and experience to perform. The third ventricle diameter measurement by
      transcranial duplex flow sonography was performed in healthy volunteers . This studies show
      similar results in those obtained with the MRI or Computer Tomography (CT). Currently the
      third ventricle diameter measurements by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was not
      validated for neuro-intensive care unit patients. The investigators propose to used recent
      ultrasound system to validate the third ventricle diameter measurements in comparison with
      the standard method (CT).

    <description>The learning curve will be determined by the change in the third ventricle diameter's difference obtained by the expert and the resident, divided by the diameter obtained by the expert reported on the Y-axis and the number of measures done by the resident reported on the X-axis. Number of measures to be done will be determined when the curve reached the zero.</description>
