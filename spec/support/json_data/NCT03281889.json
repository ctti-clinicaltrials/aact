This is the first time investigators are examining bone sparing proton therapy in pediatric craniospinal radiation.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved proton radiation for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are studying proton radiation in participants that require craniospinal radiation. The standard of care for this procedure is photon radiation, which is very similar to proton radiation. The investigators believe that the precision of proton radiation may help to reduce the negative effects radiation has on the surrounding non-cancerous growing and developing tissue"
