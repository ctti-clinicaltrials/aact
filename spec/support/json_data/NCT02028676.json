                "BriefSummary":"The two original objectives were to determine in HIV-infected children initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART):\n\nWhether clinically driven monitoring (CDM) will have a similar outcome in terms of disease progression or death as routine laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM) for toxicity (haematology/biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4)?\n\nWhether induction with four drugs from two ART classes followed by maintenance with three drugs after 36 weeks be more effective than a continuous non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-based triple drug regimen in terms of CD4 and clinical outcome?\n\nTwo secondary objectives were to determine\n\nWhether changing from twice daily lamivudine+abacavir to once daily lamivudine+abacavir after 48 weeks on ART will have a similar outcome in terms of virological suppression and will result in improvements in adherence to ART?\nWhether stopping daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in children over 3 years of age who have been on ART for at least 96 weeks has a similar outcome in terms of hospitalisation or death as continuing daily cotrimoxazole?",
                "DetailedDescription":"The ARROW (AntiRetroviral Research fOr Watoto) protocol describes an open-label randomised trial primarily evaluating two strategic approaches for management of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1200 symptomatic HIV-infected infants and children initiating ART following WHO guidelines in Uganda and Zimbabwe. The first strategy compares clinically driven monitoring (CDM) with laboratory plus clinical monitoring (LCM). In both groups, tests for toxicity (standard haematology and biochemistry panels) and efficacy (lymphocyte subsets including CD4 count) will be done every 12 weeks. In LCM, all results will be returned for patient management. In CDM, physicians may request results from routine haematology/biochemistry panels if needed for clinical management, but results will not be returned routinely, and lymphocyte subsets will never be returned. Extra laboratory tests may be requested outside of the scheduled visits at any time in either group (except for lymphocyte subsets in CDM). The second strategy compares a continuous WHO-recommended first-line ART three-drug two-class regimen, comprising two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) plus one Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), with induction with four drugs (two classes) for 36 weeks followed by maintenance with three drugs. After at least 36 and 96 weeks on ART respectively, two further randomisations will assess simplification strategies which could improve long-term ART adherence (i) once versus twice daily lamivudine+abacavir NRTI drugs (ii) stopping versus continuing daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis."

Children of DART participants should have first priority on any available remaining slots to enter ARROW.\nParents or guardians, and children where appropriate according to age and knowledge of HIV status, must be willing and able to give informed consent for randomisation to CDM or LCM and to first-line ART strategy.\n\nParticipants must have a confirmed documented diagnosis of HIV-1 infection:\n\nFor children aged under 18 months: two separate peripheral blood specimens from different days, both results being positive with HIV-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nFor children aged 18 months or over: antibody positive serology by ELISA test (confirmed by licensed second ELISA or Western Blot) or WHO approved rapid test (performed in series) both on the same sample. Any child previously tested at another clinic should have a repeat test at an ARROW screening laboratory to confirm their status.\nAge 3 months to 17 years (13-17 years to be capped at 10%)\nART naïve (except for exposure to perinatal ART for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission).\n\nMeeting criteria for requiring ART according to WHO stage and CD4 percent or count:\n\nWHO paediatric clinical stage IV disease: treat regardless of CD4 percent or count\n\nWHO paediatric clinical stage III disease:\n\n<12 months: treat all\n>12 months: treat all children irrespective of the CD4 percent or count; however, in children aged > 12 months with tuberculosis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), oral hairy leukoplakia (OHP) or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count treat) be guided by CD4 cell assays (see below).\n\nWHO paediatric clinical stage II or I disease: treat guided by CD4 percent or count\n\nCD4%<25% for infants <12 months;\nCD4%<20% for children 1-<3 years;\nCD4% <15% for children 3-<5years;\nCD4% <15% for children > 5years (consideration should also be taken of the CD4 count.
