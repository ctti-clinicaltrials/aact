However, the field currently lacks a proper understanding of how this intervention works. The overall goal of this project was to collect measurements of food bolus transit through the oropharynx (i.e., mouth and throat) during chewing, oral processing and swallowing.",
      "detailedDescription": "Aim: To explore chewing and oral processing behaviors across solid foods of different consistencies (minced and moist, soft \\& bite-sized, regular).\n\nHealthy adult participants will be asked to swallow foods representative of the \"minced and moist\", \"soft and bite-sized\" and \"regular\" consistency levels of the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative.\n\nWe will measure the number of chews taken per bolus and the overall duration of chewing to understand differences across consistencies."
