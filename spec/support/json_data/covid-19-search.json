              "BriefSummary":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety (side effects and / or adverse effects) of Triazavirin and Oseltamivir as treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Egyptian patients in military hospitals.",
              "DetailedDescription":"In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged, followed by a rapidly spread due to strong human-to-human transmission in china. Based on the clinical presentation, the pneumonia was determined to be a viral infection; the virus was initially named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and then, formally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most districts have reported zero increase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases since March 2020. As of 11 March 2020, a total of 80 955 laboratory-confirmed cases had been documented in China.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. The mortality rate was found to be 3.9% according to the data at that time. Given the human-to-human transmission and high infectivity of the disease, COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading in Republic of Korea, Iran, Italy, the United States, and Europe. A number of studies and reports have identified a median incubation period of 4 d and have determined that the top four symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness/pain.\n\nThe most unfortunate fact is that there have been no effective therapies for preventing and treating COVID-19 to date. Although Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine have been found to be effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2, the data obtained thus far are primarily from in vitro studies, but their effectiveness in vivo still questionable. Interferon, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Arbidol, Ribavirin, and the therapeutic application of plasma antibodies have also been recommended as alternatives for the treatment of patients with COVID-19; however, the efficacy and safety of these drugs remain to be verified in patients, and their applications are yet to be validated by scientifically sound randomized clinical trials (RCTs).\n\nTriazavirin (TZV), a new antiviral drug, has been on the market in Russia since 2015. It is a synthetic compound analogue to the purine nucleoside bases. The principle mode of action of TZV is inhibiting the synthesis of viral RNA and preventing the replication of genomic fragments. Because of its multiple-target mechanism of action, TZV has a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against RNA-containing viruses, including influenza A virus (H5N1, etc.), influenza B virus, tick-borne encephalitis, and Forest-Spring encephalitis, both in vitro and in animal models in vivo.\n\nOseltamivir is a first-line antiviral drug, especially in primary hospitals of military medical hospitals. During the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most patients with COVID-19 who are symptomatic have used Oseltamivir. Considering its popular and important role as an antiviral drug, it is necessary to evaluate oseltamivir in the treatment of COVID-19 . Oseltamivir inhibits the neuraminidase enzyme, which is expressed on the viral surface. The enzyme promotes release of virus from infected cells and facilitates viral movement within the respiratory tract. In the presence of neuraminidase inhibitors, virions stay attached to the membrane of infected cells and are also entrapped in respiratory secretions."

France is the third most affected country in Europe after Italy and Spain. Groups of patients at a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 have been defined: this include patients with immunosuppressive disease as cancer or patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver. Coronavirus liver injury had been described with SARS-CoV 1 and MERS-CoV. There is no data on liver damage associated with COVID-19 infection for compensated or decompensated cirrhotic patients. The objectives of this project are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in hepatocellular carcinoma population, both hospital and ambulatory, and to study the impact on the frequency of severe forms, the prognosis, but also liver function, and the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, in this context of pandemic"

By 2022, the virus has infected more than 500 million people worldwide and caused more than 6 million deaths.\n\nCase fatality rates (CFR) are an important index that helps to understand the epidemiological characteristics of an epidemic. In the data coming in 2020, COVID-19 CFR values were generally reported in the range of 0.001-0.706. However, from 2019 to 2022, there were 2 major changes that could affect the CFR of the disease. The first of these is vaccine applications, and the second is the new variants of SARS-CoV-2, which appeared first. From 2019 to 2022, it is likely that there will be a change in the mortality of COVID-19 in relation to both the vaccines administered and the new variants emerging.

              "DetailedDescription":"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The disease spread to many countries in a few weeks, becoming a global public health problem, and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has caused widespread deaths worldwide, especially by causing widespread involvement in the lungs and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. By 2022, the virus has infected more than 500 million people worldwide and caused more than 6 million deaths.\n\nCase fatality rates (CFR) are an important index that helps to understand the epidemiological characteristics of an epidemic. The CFR for COVID 19 is the number of deaths in COVID-19 cases divided by the total number of people infected with COVID-19. After the emergence of the disease in 2019, the CFR figures reported for COVID-19 in 2020 began to become clear. In the data coming in 2020, COVID-19 CFR values are generally reported in the range of 0.001-0.706. However, from 2019 to 2022, there were 2 major changes that could affect the CFR of the disease. The first of these is the vaccine applications developed against COVID-19. The first vaccine studies have matured by 2020 and started to be applied widely in the world in 2021. the second is the new variants of the first emerging SARS-CoV-2. In 2021, variants started to be defined and Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants were reported as dominance variants from time to time. From 2019 to 2022, it is likely that there will be a change in the mortality of COVID-19 in relation to both the vaccines administered and the new variants emerging. Knowing the possible changes that may occur in COVID-19 mortality may cause changes in the COVID-19 measures applied all over the world. In this way, it may be possible to reduce unnecessary health costs and direct health resources to appropriate areas.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine whether there is a change in the mortality of COVID-19 from 2019, when it first appeared, to 2022.\n\nIn this study, patient data were obtained retrospectively in a training and research hospital COVID-19 outpatient clinic. The obtained daily number of patients in 2020, CFR rates were compared with the number of daily patients and CFR rates in 2022. In this way, it was tested whether there was a significant difference between the year 2020, when the disease first became widespread, and 2022."

              "BriefSummary":"Rationale:\n\nIn the treatment, care and isolation of COVID-19 patients, one of the most important issues is determining the duration of infectiousness. The current Dutch guideline advises at least 14 days of isolation for seriously ill patients, which is the case for most admitted patients, and at least 21 days for intubated patients. It is believed that in most cases this isolation duration is too long, which is highly undesirable for patients staying in closed single-occupancy rooms. This is known to result in limited contact with healthcare workers (HCW) and to be associated with a higher level of depression among patients. The longer the isolation, the higher the workload for HCW and the higher the costs (e.g. with about 0.5 million admission days in the Netherlands, these work out at about €14 million on personal protective equipment [PPE] and cleaning alone). Additionally, isolation demands a larger healthcare workforce, yielding less capacity to provide other care to non-COVID-19 patients, with numerous other consequences. On the other hand, it is possible that some patients were discontinued from isolation too early, leading to a risk of transmission to other patients and to HCW. In conclusion, duration of isolation should be as short as possible for proper patient flow and to avoid unnecessary burden to patients and HCW, and thus to healthcare in general. Therefore, there is an urgent need to define the period of infectiousness of COVID-19. We will develop a safe and effective algorithm for decision on timely discontinuation of isolation of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to produce new evidence-based criteria for the termination of isolation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are safe (very low subsequent risk of transmission to other patients or healthcare workers) while reducing the number of unnecessary days in isolation (thereby improving quality of life of patients, reducing hospital costs, and making optimal use of the scarce number of isolation beds). Multiple sources of data and evidence will be integrated to arrive at these new criteria.",

In response, the administration of a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine was considered to address potential waning immunity over time and reduced effectiveness against the Omicron/ Delta variant. The pandemic also resulted in many infections among health care workers (HCWs) and their households. In this study, a retrospective analysis would perform on risk of COVID-19 infection and their outcome in relation to their COVID-19 vaccination history by using the data repository from one of the Hong Kong private hospitals.\n\nHCWs were required to submit a standardized online self-declaration form for report of 1) demographic of the HCWs, 2) symptoms related history and 3) COVID-19 exposure history once they were COVID-19 confirmed by rapid antigen test against COVID-19 and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. Subsequent follow up such as contact tracing, COVID-19 PCR testing results of these HCWs and status of return to work were captured by the infection control team in a systematic manner."

              "BriefSummary":"The approval and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is an important milestone in the fight against the pandemic. However, although vaccines are widely recognized as a key public health measure to control infectious disease, there are still people who remain hesitant to get vaccinated. In Canada, 83% of Canadian adults have received or are willing to receive the vaccine. However, nearly 20% of adults and a larger proportion of parents of younger children remain concerned about receiving vaccines. In the context of a project to enable family physicians to identify vaccine-hesitant patients and deliver a tailored COVID-19 vaccination outreach campaign, the Canadian Practice Information Network, a tool for primary care providers to communicate with their patients, will be used to engage and address vaccination hesitancy in Canada. The study will identify information needs about COVID-19 vaccination among community-dwelling patients in three Canadian provinces and will assess the effectiveness of a tailored COVID-19 vaccine digital health communication strategy for primary care practices to address vaccination hesitancy and improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake.\n\nA two-arm cluster randomized trial design will be conducted in primary care practices in three Canadian provinces: Ontario, British Columbia, and New Brunswick. The study will use a convenience sample of primary care practice in these provinces. Recruited participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups. Patients assigned to the control group will receive health messages unrelated to the COVID-19.\n\nParticipants in the intervention group will receive a series of tailored messages on COVID-19 vaccination targeting the main factors for hesitancy to address their concerns and persuade them to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Aggregated survey responses across practices will be used to create segments of unvaccinated patients reflecting age, language, education level, rurality, sex, gender, ethnicity, and their attitudes or reasons for vaccine hesitancy or access barriers. Then, tailored messages will be created in a way that is meaningful to the recipients in the different segments.\n\nThe primary outcome is the proportion of vaccine-hesitant individuals who receive a COVID-19 vaccine during the intervention period. The secondary outcome is the overall COVID-19 vaccine uptake.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Background. The approval and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is a key milestone in the fight against the pandemic. As many countries around have rapidly implemented complex vaccination programs, there are still people who remain hesitant to get vaccinated. In Canada, 83% of Canadian adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but nearly 20% of adults remain concerned about receiving vaccines. Canadian primary care providers have not had a large role to date in the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, despite their traditional role in vaccinating infants and seniors. Nonetheless, primary care providers can play a key role in decreasing vaccine hesitancy, as they are one of the most trusted emissaries of people who are vaccine-hesitant. The Canadian Practice Information Network (CPIN), a primary care practice tool, can be used by primary care providers to send messages to patients across small independent primary care practices to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Canada. Because of their trusted relationship, messages sent by the patient's primary care provider are read and 60% of CPIN surveys completed,9 making this an efficient tool for patient engagement.\n\nAn experimental study will be conducted using CPIN as a tool for primary care providers across Canada to communicate and engage with their patients regarding COVID-19 vaccines to identify and address vaccination hesitancy in their own patient populations. A survey will be conducted to explore the reasons for vaccine hesitancy among the unvaccinated population of each participating provider as well as their unmet information needs about COVID-19 vaccination. This will then enable family physicians to implement a targeted and tailored COVID-19 vaccine digital health communication strategy reaching patients by e-mail or text to address vaccination hesitancy and improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake. The effectiveness of this communication strategy in persuading patients to get vaccinated against COVID-19 will be evaluated.\n\nTrial design. A two-arm, pragmatic cluster randomized trial design will be used.\n\nSetting and sample. The study will be conducted in primary care practices across Canada. The study will occur in a convenience sample of any model of comprehensive primary care practices. All primary care providers who provide comprehensive care for a defined patient panel that represents at least 75% of their patient population and who have been with the practice for > 2 years are eligible to participate including those who work part-time. Providers are considered to be in the same practice if they share at least four of the following: patient electronic medical record, waiting room, receptionist, coverage after hours, telephone number, and address.\n\nThrough CPIN, 300 providers across 100 Canadian practices will be used for connecting patients and physicians. It is assumed that each provider will care for on average 800 adult patients and that 20% are not yet vaccinated. CPIN will be used to send a questionnaire to at least 180,000 adult patients with email or cell number on record, to recruit participants. The questionnaire will ask patients about COVID-19 vaccination status and intention and, if not vaccinated, their reasons for vaccine hesitancy based on the Health Belief Model, or barriers to access. The survey responses will be aggregated across practices and use machine learning to classify the unvaccinated patients into distinct segments reflecting age, language, education level, rurality, sex, gender, ethnicity, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and barriers to access.\n\nRecruitment and randomization. Participants will be recruited among non-vaccinated patients from participating primary care (PC) practices in the three provinces. Participating patients will be the unit of randomization. Inclusion criteria are patients registered with a participating provider, aged 18 years or older, of either sex, in a participating primary care practice, who speak one of Canada's official languages (English and French), who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine and agree to participate in the study. A returned completed questionnaire will be interpreted as voluntary participation in the study. Recruited participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups. Patients assigned to the control group will receive health messages unrelated to the COVID-19. Rolling recruitment of patients from each practice will be spread over a four-month period.\n\nPrimary outcome. The principal outcome is the proportion of vaccine-hesitant individuals who receive a COVID-19 vaccine during the intervention period. The COVID-19 vaccination status will be patient-reported on the questionnaires sent by CPIN. Secondary outcomes will be a measure of patient willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The mean patient ratings will be used to measure the performance of different messages. All outcomes will be reported by practice population segments and shared with participating practices.\n\nPower and Sample size. Based on a conservative estimate informed by previous studies, it is expected our intervention to lead to at least a 4% relative increase in the vaccination rate within the experimental group. Considering a 3:1 allocation ratio to intervention and control groups, an intracluster correlation (ICC)=0.05 to adjust for clustering at the level of the provider and practice, a minimum sample size of 4,320 individuals would be required to detect at least 4% difference between the intervention and control groups with an alpha=0.05 and power=90% (using n4props function of the CRTSize R package).\n\nQualitative data collection. Applying a mixed-method approach, online card sorting and focus groups will be used to assist in designing and evaluating our tailored health messages. Message usefulness, visual engagement, and persuasiveness will be assessed through the card sorting method and the use of personas.\n\nPatient focus groups will be conducted following the initial survey and at the end of the intervention. The main purpose of the focus groups is to provide qualitative feedback on the usefulness of the health messages designed and the meaningful use of various visual designs from the patients' perspective. In so doing, a user-centered design approach will be adopted. This approach aims at involving our participants in the design process. A total of approximately 20 patients will be divided into focus groups of 4-5 participants at each of the initial and final time points for a total of 40 participants. Participant feedback will be elicited in a rating question after each message sent, and this will be considered in the content and visual design of each subsequent message to strengthen the message tailoring to the needs of the targeted patient population segment who will receive it.\n\nStudy intervention. Adult patients from practices recruited across the country will be sent an initial message introducing the CPIN service. A survey link will seek patients' informed consent and if given, patients will immediately be asked about their vaccination status, attitudes, and intentions around the COVID-19 vaccines, minority group membership, education level, and preferred language of health communication. The survey responses will be aggregated across practices and create up to ten separate segments of unvaccinated patients reflecting age, language, education level, rurality, sex, gender, ethnicity, and most importantly, their attitudes or reasons for vaccine hesitancy or access barriers. Then message content will be created in a way that is meaningful to the recipients in the different segments.\n\nThe Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU) will work with the Communications Lab at the University of Ottawa to identify major controversies emerging in public discourse that might feed vaccine hesitancy and advise the EOHU to tailor our messages accordingly. Then, evidence-based messages will be produced, tailored to specific population segments based on demographic and behavioral or belief variables and adapt the way the content is presented based on feedback from patients in those segments. The data feedback across practices will be also aggregated to evaluate the performance of our tailored communication strategy in near real-time and adjust it as needed.\n\nStatistical analysis. Once all participants have been randomized, descriptive statistics will be used to compare the two groups at baseline. All analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis and will use individual participants as the unit of analysis. Descriptive analyses will be performed for selected patient demographic characteristics (age, sex, education), as well as by population segments. Chi-square tests will be used to examine whether individual characteristics differ between the intervention and control arms.\n\nThe proportion of individuals who were vaccinated within each intervention arm will be compared, overall and by population segment. Similarly, the proportion of individuals with strong, moderate, and low hesitancy to be vaccinated within each intervention arm will be compared, overall and by population segment and sociodemographic characteristics. Analysis of differences in the proportions of the main endpoint, vaccination status against COVID-19, as well as willingness to receive the vaccine, between the two arms will be performed using 2-sided chi-square tests. Asymptotic confidence limits on the differences and relative rate ratios will be calculated to assess the magnitude of the effect on the changes in the hesitancy and vaccination rates pre and post-intervention.\n\nTo determine which patient and practice characteristics are related to the likelihood for hesitancy while accounting for the clustered nature of the data, two-level generalized linear mixed modeling will be conducted using the willingness to be vaccinated (hesitant versus not hesitant) as the binary outcome variable. The Level 1 independent variables will be age, ethnic group, income level, and rurality of residence. The Level 2 independent variables will be the pre-intervention vaccination rate calculated to account for sociodemographic characteristics and intervention arm (Intervention versus Control).\n\nTo examine the variations of the results at individual and practice levels a multilevel logistic regression model will be fit to assess the individual and practice level changes for the hesitancy status and the attitudes and reasons for hesitancy. Subgroup analyses will be conducted to determine whether there is any significant heterogeneity in treatment effects occurring between population segments defined by different gender, age group, education level, and ethnic group.\n\nQualitative analysis. The overall goal of the analytical process of the focus group is a) to gathering information and explanation regarding the usefulness, persuasiveness, and visual engagement of the health messages, and b) to identify key requirements for designing tailored health messages. The data will be analyzed in two steps. First, a thematic analysis of the transcripts of the focus group will be done via NVivo software. The thematic analysis will be performed in four stages: data immersion, coding, identifying emerging sub-themes, and data reduction. Themes, sub-themes, and quotes will be tabulated, summarized, and shared between the team of researchers for validation during coordination meetings (once a month). To ensure the quality and validity of the thematic analysis, the initial analysis will be carried out by the researcher who had done the focus groups and will be cross-checked for achieving intercoder reliability. Secondly, the findings from the thematic analysis will be imported into XmindPro8 software and interactively, organized to identify conceptual groupings and similarities and differences."

              "BriefSummary":"The novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-C0V 2) originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. As of April 15 2020, the virus has spread across 213 countries/territories with 1,914,916 cases and 123,010 deaths and a crude case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4%. In Bangladesh, the situation is also grave. As of May 14, 2020, there were 18,863 cases and 283 deaths.\n\nIn order to suppress COVID-19 transmission, it is important to diagnose COVID-19 patients, which would help in the process of quarantine and isolation of the patients and also in contact tracing. COVID-19 testing can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus and includes methods that detect the presence of virus itself such as real time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), isothermal nucleic acid amplification, antigen) and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection. Until now, RT-PCR has been known as the best approach for - detection. It would be very useful if Bangladesh had its own locally produced RT-PCR kits, provided that the kits are no less in quality than imported kits in terms of sensitivity, specificity, price etc. The present study aims to carry out the performance evaluation of RealDetect RT-PCR Kit for COVID-19 detection.\n\nThe RealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnostic panel is a locally produced real-time RT-PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals who meet SARS-CoV-2 clinical criteria. The approach is based on the RT-PCR method which uses two (Nucleocapsid 1, Nucleocapsid 2) sets of gene-specific primers and corresponding fluorescent probes to detect two specific regions within the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid protein Nucleocapsid gene. This RT-PCR panel detects SARS-CoV-2 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) specifically. The approach does not generate any false positives to other coronaviruses or human microflora. The kit also contains a primer-probe set which detects human housekeeping gene, ribonuclease Protein (RNase P). That is, the Ribonuclease Protein (RNase P) serves as an internal reference control to monitor sample collection, ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, and amplification.\n\nThis is a case control study. The study will analyze 120 samples (60 COVID-19 positive and 60 COVID-19 negative both fresh and frozen) from Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). These specimens will be blinded before handing over to Institute for Developing Science & Health Initiatives (ideSHi) for RealDetect Kit. All samples will be analyzed by Real Time PCR System. Necessary validation will also be carried out at the COVID-19 laboratory of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital and an external validation expert will be involved. The Principal Investigator (PI) will also receive the sample information regarding positive/negative status from Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and compare ideSHi and IEDCR data. Unpaired t-test, Wilcox's test, Rank test, Compare test, Mean test, Sensitivity/Specificity test, Regression analysis and Geometric mean with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) will be used to analyze the data. It needs to conduct a univariate analysis.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Considering the current global pandemic, just like any other countries it is becoming very difficult for Bangladesh to fight the COVID-19 spread. An increased number of testing is needed in Bangladesh and to cope with this demand an increase in assay kits are needed urgently in the country.\n\nCurrently we are totally dependent on imported test kits. At the time when the whole world is facing a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, import from other countries seems to be very difficult. Primarily, countries manufacturing these kits are focused on meeting the demand in their own countries first and thus those countries impose a ban on exporting these kits. So, availability of the kits will become a big problem for Bangladesh to increase testing in the country.\n\nSecondly, due to lockdown situation worldwide, transporting these kits from another country seems second big issue we are facing right now. The kits are stranded in the airports for weeks before reaching in our country. Not to mention, the quality of the test kits is being jeopardized in the whole uncertain transportation process. The RT-PCR test kits are very temperature sensitive and maintaining the cold chain is mandatory in order to perform the test properly.\n\nOnce approved, this qualitative RT-PCR based kit can be a principal tool for Bangladesh in effective diagnosis and clinical management of COVID-19 along with collective actions made by the govt. of Bangladesh. Being developed and manufactured in Bangladesh means that there will be no shortage of testing kits during this pandemic and it will also be possible to export the kit after fulfilling domestic needs. The kit will definitely be cost-effective compared to other commercially available kits & the price will be around 30% less than the commercially available kits in the country. Current purchase price of Bangladesh govt. per test of the imported COVID-19 RT-PCR test is approx. Tk. 2780/= & RealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR per test cost will be approx. Tk. 1940/=\n\nHowever, this type of performance evaluation study on RT-PCR method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus has not yet been done in our country. This is\n\nthe rationale why we have designed this protocol for performance evaluation of RealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR kit in Bangladesh for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nRealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR will be an effective diagnostic tool for the detection of SARS CoV-2 virus using nasopharyngeal swab specimens.\n\nMethodology:\n\nStudy type & purpose:\n\nThis is a case control study. This study is expected to validate whether the locally developed RealDetect COVID-19 RT-PCR kit is suitable for the use in Bangladesh for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients.\n\nStudy Population and samples Testing and analysis of a total of 120 specimens will be carried out. Of the 120 samples, 60 will be stored samples (30 COVID-19 positive samples and 30 COVID-19 negative samples) from IEDCR. The positive/negative status of the samples will be blinded before sending to ideSHi. The samples have already been stored at -80 degree Celsius in the IEDCR freezer.\n\nIn addition, 60 fresh specimens which will be tested at IEDCR will also be tested at ideSHi using RealDetect on a real time basis. These samples will also be blinded by IEDCR and sent to the testing laboratory (ideSHi) as they become available. Of these 60 samples, 30 will be COVID-19 positive and 30 COVID- 19 negative samples. These fresh samples will be provided to ideSHi for testing and analysis for performance evaluation of RealDetect COVID-19 RT-PCR kit. The PI will coordinate these activities.\n\nIEDCR will provide ideSHi with the samples needed for the performance evaluation study of RealDetect RT-PCR Kit for COVID-19 detection. It should be mentioned here that IEDCR is the government reference laboratory for COVID-19 detection in Bangladesh. There is a MOU between ideSHi and IEDCR and these two organizations have been doing collaborative work from 2014. Thus IEDCR has been involved in this study.\n\nTo avoid biasness, ideSHi (CRO) investigators will be blinded to the samples provided by IEDCR. That is, ideSHi investigators will not know which of the 60 samples are positive and which of the 60 samples are negative. After RT- PCR run using RealDetect RT-PCR Kit, ideSHi will send the results to the Principal investigator. The Principal investigator will also receive IEDCR results for the same samples. Finally, the PI will compare the results from ideSHi and IEDCR and determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.\n\nStudy Design: Case control study.\n\nStatistical Basis of Sample Size:\n\nFormulae:\n\nVariable Notations:\n\nΑ (the probability of type I error) (significance level) is the probability of rejecting the true null hypothesis (0.05) Β (the probability of type II error) (1 - power of the test) is the probability of failing to reject the false null hypothesis (0.80).\n\nPA (proportion of discordant pairs of type A), proportion of discordant pairs of type A among discordant pairs (1/4) PD (proportion of discordant pairs) among all pairs (0.11)\n\nNpairs, required sample size pairs 2x60=120 A matched-pair design is used, with one patient in a matched pair assigned to RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 and the other one to RT-PCR negative for COVID-19. How many matched pairs need to be enrolled in the study to have a 95% chance of finding a significant difference using a two-sided test with type I error = 0.05? So, we will use a total of 120 samples; 60 COVID-19 positive samples and 60 COVID-19 negative samples.\n\nDiagnostic Criteria for selection of COVID-19 positive and negative specimens:\n\nIEDCR uses many different kits for COVID-19 detection. These kits include, (1) A*Star Fortitute Kit 2 for COVID-19 detection (Singapure), (2) Sansure Biotec Limited (China), (3) ModularDx Kit (TIB Molecular Biology, Germany, and (4) DaAn Kit (China). Among these 2 kits, A*Star Fortitude Kit 2 has been known as the best kit in IEDCR depending on its performance because it rarely generates false positive or false negative results.\n\nA*Star Fortitude Kit 2 is used for confirmation of any discordant results for other kits in IEDCR. That is, IEDCR uses A*Star Fortitude Kit for COVID detection as the Gold Standard. In our case, this is the main reason for the selection of this kit in order to compare the performances of RealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR kit.\n\nConsents from the patients are not required. Specimens will be obtained from IEDCR and so there is no requirement of patient's enrollment and consents from the patients.\n\nAll specimens will be diagnosed as COVID-19 positive on the basis RT-PCR positive results with Ct value ≤ 30 for the viral RNA. If the respiratory\n\nspecimens give positive results upon RT-PCR analysis at the lab targeting the conserved viral gene(s) for SARS-CoV-2, it will be considered as confirmed positive case for COVID-19.\n\nOn the other hand, if the respiratory specimens give negative results with no amplification upon RT-PCR analysis at the lab targeting the conserved viral gene(s) for SARS-CoV-2, it will be considered as confirmed negative case for COVID-19.\n\nPlace of study: Institute for Developing Science & Health Initiatives (ideSHi) ; Mohakhali, Dhaka.\n\nSample Collection Site(s): Virology Laboratory, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), Mohakhali, Dhaka\n\nNote: IEDCR will provide ideSHi with the samples needed for the performance evaluation study of RealDetect RT-PCR Kit for COVID-19 detection. It should be mentioned here that IEDCR is the government reference laboratory for COVID-19 detection in Bangladesh. IEDCR has its own stored samples in - 80°C. There is a MOU between ideSHi and IEDCR and these two organizations have been doing collaborative work from 2014.\n\nData Collection Procedure: COVID-19 positive samples will be confirmed by laboratory findings of positive RT-PCR results for the viral RNA. Selection of the specimens will be carried out following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After data collection, data will be stored in an Excel sheet for later analysis.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nThe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of RealDetect™ RT-PCR kit will be determined. Alongside sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, Kappa coefficient, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio will also be calculated\n\nUnpaired t-test, Wilcox's test, Rank test, compare test, Mean test, Sensitivity/Specificity test, Regression analysis and Geometric mean with 95% CI will be used to analyze the data. It will need to conduct a univariate analysis. A p value of ≤0.05 will be considered as the level of significant association. The sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-) and efficiency will be calculated using the following formulae in which TP is the number of true positives, FP the number of false positives, False negative (FN) the number of false negatives and True Negative (TN) the number of true negatives: Sensitivity = True positive (TP)/[TP + FN]; Specificity = TN/ [TN + False positive (FP)]; Kappa coefficient K=(Observed Agreement (OA)- Agreement by Chance (AC)/ (1-AC); Accuracy = [TP + TN]/ [TP + TN +FP + FN]; Positive predictive value (PPV) = TP/[TP + FP]; Negative predictive value (NPV) = TN/[TN + FN]; LR+= sensitivity/ [100 - specificity] and LR- = [100 - sensitivity]/specificity\n\nUtilization of Results:\n\nBangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC) ethical clearance is needed for performance evaluation study of the RealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR kit.\nThis will help for further processing of RealDetect™ COVID-19 RT-PCR kit for Director General of Drug Administration (DGDA) regulations to legally market the products in Bangladesh.\n\nFacilities:\n\nThe Principal Investigator and other investigators of the Bangladesh University of Health Sciences (BUHS) will be coordinating the evaluation and data analysis and publication. However, the testing will be carried out in a separate organization using blinded specimens from IEDCR at the ideSHi. It is one of the Government selected organizations which has been assigned for COVID-19 testing to provide services and is also a registered Contract Research Organization (CRO). The institute has international standard Biological Safety Levels (BSL) 2 plus and BSL facilities with sophisticated equipment like real time PCR machine which is required for real time RT-PCR for COVID-19 detection.\n\nApproval of the Head of the Department/Institute:\n\nThis collaborative study will be carried out in the following institutes:\n\nInstitute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), Mohakhali, Dhaka (For sample collection & sample storage) And Institute for Developing Science & Health Initiatives (ideSHi); Mohakhali, Dhaka (For sample analysis, data collection, data analysis)\n\nEthical Implications:\n\nTo avoid the biasness, the study will be blinded to ideSHi researchers who will be involved in the study.\n\nPermission will be taken from Bangladesh Medical Research Council.\n\nThe privacy and confidentiality will be strictly maintained during and after data collection and data storage."

              "BriefSummary":"Corona Virus - 19 Disease (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), first appeared in Wuhan city of Hubei province of China and spread rapidly, causing a pandemic. In the period from the first emergence of the disease to the present, 336,790,193 people have been infected and 5,560,718 people have died. Considering the severity of the disease, some quarantine measures should be applied, as in many infectious diseases, among the first measures taken worldwide to prevent the spread of the virus.It has been suggested in a limited number of studies conducted in the last two years that climatic conditions may be among the main factors affecting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is no consensus on the effects of factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind on the spread of the disease, and there are conflicting results. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the rate of spread of COVID-19, the rate of intensive care hospitalization and fatality, and weather conditions.",
              "DetailedDescription":"From the first appearance of COVID-19 to the present, 336,790,193 people have been infected and 5,560,718 people have died (Web Page: https://covid19.who.int/ accessed on 21 January 2022). Considering the severity of the disease, some quarantine measures should be applied, as in many infectious diseases, among the first measures taken worldwide to prevent the spread of the virus. However, these practices may cause the society to be negatively affected economically, socially and psychologically over time (1). Predicting the conditions that increase the spread of the disease, optimizing quarantine practices, preparing health institutions for epidemic disease conditions and minimizing the negative effects of practices on society are very important in such pandemic epidemics that have the potential to affect the whole world for years.\n\nIn the last two decades, it has been reported that the survival time of the virus in the air, its spreading rate and virulence are affected by weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed in epidemics caused by viruses that are transmitted by droplets and cause respiratory diseases (2,3). Similarly, a limited number of studies conducted in the last two years have suggested that climatic conditions may be among the main factors affecting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (1.4-6). In addition, almost all of these studies were carried out on the basis of the number of patients presented by the health authorities of the countries, and they are not field studies. This situation, on the other hand, has the potential to ignore patients who have only Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) positivity as the basis for patient identification, and therefore patients with clinical and imaging COVID-19 and test negativity. While investigating the relationship between the rate of spread and virulence of COVID-19 and seasonal climatic conditions, conducting the study in a region where all the factors that have the potential to affect the spread of the virus are as similar as possible, over a wide period of time, including seasonal changes, may provide more information. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the rate of spread of COVID-19, the rate of intensive care hospitalization and fatality, and weather conditions.\n\nThis retrospective observational multicenter study was conducted by examining the 284-day data of Covid-19 outpatient clinics of two large University hospitals located in the south and north of the city of Izmir in Turkey. The province of İzmir, where the research was carried out, is located between 38-39 north latitudes and 26-28 east meridians in terms of geographical location. It is Turkey's 3rd largest city and its total population in 2020 is approximately 4.4 million people. The centers where the study was conducted are the university hospitals in the north and south of the city, which have been serving as pandemic centers since the beginning of the pandemic and where the city's highest number of patient admissions. Before starting the study, approval was obtained from the hospital local ethics committee with the number GOKAE-2020-190 and from the Ministry of Health with the number 2020-05-04T09_17_13.\n\nThe data were obtained by examining the patient records who applied to the COVID-19 outpatient clinics of both central hospitals where the study was conducted between March 2020 and January 2021. The data were analyzed day by day, covering 284 days. During the study period, the number, gender, age and clinical outcome of all patients with positive PCR test among the patients who applied to the Covid outpatient clinics of both hospitals (decision of outpatient follow-up, decision of hospitalization, decision of admission to intensive care unit and ex) were recorded. . Patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on clinical and imaging studies and were therefore recommended isolation or hospitalization were enrolled among the patients who had negative PCR tests. While patients with negative PCR were diagnosed with Covid-19 in their applications to the Covid-19 outpatient clinics of both hospitals, the North American Society of Radiology Covid-19 CT imaging expert consensus report is taken as a basis for radiological images. According to this report, those with Lung CT Type 1 or Type 2 are considered Covid-19, while those with Type 3 or who are clinically compatible with Covid-19 in patients with no infiltration on imaging or who were not sent for imaging, accompanied by normal or low white blood cell count and low neutrophil count, have high Patients are diagnosed with Covid-19 using platelet count parameters. The hospital records of these patients were reviewed, and patients whose diagnosis changed according to repeated PCR test, swab test results for other viral agents, repetitive imaging, and laboratory results were excluded from the study. Clinical outcome was followed up 1 month after the first admission of the patients and until discharge or death in hospitalized patients. The application date of the patients who had recurrent applications during the same disease process was taken as the first application date, and the records of the patients whose clinical decision was later changed to hospitalization and intensive care unit were reduced to a single record and the final clinical outcome was taken as the basis. In this way, the number of patients who received outpatient treatment, hospitalized, intensive care and ex-patient treatment due to Covid-19 were determined and recorded. The rate of hospitalization of the patients in the intensive care unit was calculated with the formula of the number of patients admitted to the daily intensive care unit / Number of patients diagnosed with covid daily, and the fatality rate was calculated with the formula: Number of patients who died per day / Number of patients diagnosed with daily covid, and was recorded.\n\nWeather data with official application from the General Directorate of Meteorology, daily minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), wind speed (m/s) and direction, humidity (%) within the working period. was obtained as the amount of precipitation (kg/m2).\n\nDescriptive statistics; frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values will be obtained. Number and percentage for categorical variables, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum values and interquartile range (IQR) for numerical variables will be calculated. Histogram curves, kurtosis-skewness values and the Shapiro-Wilks test will be used to test whether the continuous variables are normally distributed. The seasonal parameters, temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation, will be correlated with the number of patients per day. By obtaining the same parameters and the graph showing the distribution with the number of patients, the temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation levels with the increase in the number of patients will be determined."

As the virus spread in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital (HKSH) is one of the first private hospitals which immediately provide reliable and rapid COVID-19 test -- Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Early provision of the RT-PCR screening test for COVID-19 not only facilitates identification of COVID-19 but also contains the spread of the virus in the community and frontline medical staff.\n\nSince description of role of private hospital in Hong Kong amid COVID-19 pandemic is lacking, this study will describe COVID-19 screening algorithm and methodology. A retrospective analysis on clinical characteristics, laboratory findings as well as outcome of patients who underwent COVID-19 test in HKSH is also performed."

              "DetailedDescription":"The epidemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented public health crisis in the United States. African Americans (AA) have been disproportionately impacted, as systemic inequities have contributed to increased exposure and vulnerability to COVID-19. Evidence suggests that AAs are delaying testing and care for COVID-19, which increases risk of transmission and poor outcomes. In Chicago, segregated AA neighborhoods have experienced some of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in the city, yet large portions of these neighborhoods remain testing deserts. Providing trusted, accessible, community-based testing in underserved AA communities is critical to ensuring that AAs receive an early diagnosis, thereby reducing the risk of further transmission and improving clinical outcomes. This study leverages the Alive Church Network (ACN), a long-standing, community-driven coalition of African American pastors and public health researchers that was developed as a sustainable infrastructure to address health inequities in chronic disease in segregated AA neighborhoods in Chicago. The ACN was designed to address lack of access to health care, cultural insensitivity, and lack of trust, which are the root cause of disparities in chronic disease as well as infectious disease, including COVID-19. This project utilizes the ACN infrastructure to create a network of church-based testing sites in a segregated and underserved AA neighborhood in Chicago that will provide COVID-19 testing and education as well as linkage to healthcare and social resources. Pastors who serve predominantly AA congregations on the South Side of Chicago will form a coalition to promote community-wide COVID-19 testing in local churches and church-based events where residents are congregating, such as Sunday church services, food pantries, and other gatherings. Residents of all ages will receive COVID-19 education and free severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing with rapid turn-around of results from an on-site clinical team, as well as connection to local resources to address social needs, including food, housing, and medical care. At-home COVID-19 tests will also be provided to residents for their personal use and to distribute to others in their social network. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the ACN COVID-19 testing intervention on uptake of testing among residents of target high poverty AA neighborhoods in Chicago. The primary analysis uses an interrupted time series framework, which is a quasi-experimental approach, to test whether the ACN testing intervention is successful at increasing uptake of testing by at least 20% among residents in the target neighborhoods."

The investigators hypothesize that the testing intervention will increase uptake of testing by at least 20%. To assess the impact of the intervention, the investigators will use an interrupted time series (ITS) framework to test the null hypothesis that the addition of the COVID-19 testing intervention would result in no significant change in the level or trend of weekly COVID-19 testing for neighborhood residents. ITS analysis is a quasi-experimental approach to establish causal inference in situations where randomized controlled trials are not feasible, and uses segmented regression to measure changes in the level and slope of the outcome in a post-intervention period compared to a pre-intervention period.",

              "BriefSummary":"One case of maternal-fetal transmission of SARS Cov-2 was published (1). Ig M and Ig G were found at two hours after birth of a new born from a mother COVID-19. Another study on few newborns COVID-19 reported that the SARS-Cov-2 was not transmitted in utero but only after birth.\n\nAlthough there are few data on COVID-19 during pregnancy, according to our national data collections, it appears to be responsible for miscarriages and fetal deaths. There are also intrauterine growth restrictions and an increase of the rate of cesarean sections for maternal indications. Therefore, it is essential to know if there is a maternal viremia which infects the fetus because the consequences in terms of management would be completely different.\n\nIn fact, the potential intrauterine infection will lead to antenatal monitoring of these patients with an antenatal diagnosis and may be a treatment.\n\nTherefore, it seems essential to explore the mode of transmission to the newborn since many newborns have COVID-19 infection The investigators will propose to all pregnant women SARS- Cov-2 positive to perform PCR SARS-Cov-2 tests and /or serology's (IgM and Ig G) on the amniotic fluid, the blood cord and the placenta.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Pregnant women SARS cov-2 positives during pregnancy or during labor tested by a RT-PCR SARS-Cov-2 on nasopharyngeal swabs and/or by serologies.\n\nAfter informed consent the ivestigators will proceed during labor to:\n\nA vaginal swab of amniotic fluid during the rupture of the water pocket during labor.\n\na blood sample from the umbilical cord after delivery of the newborn and clamping and sectioning of the cord. PCR Covid-19 and serologies (Ig M and Ig G) as well as investigating viral proteome and cytokines.\n\nThese are additional samples in addition to the routine samples which have no impact and without risk for the mother the newborn since they are taken after delivery from the side of the placenta after clamping and sectioning of the cord.\n\nSamples of 2 fragments of placenta after delivery of the placenta for COVID-19 research, which usually goes to waste or to pathology depending on the clinical context or for infectious tests. In all cases, samples of 3 to 4 cm3 will be taken which will in no way interfere with current analyzes carried out on the placenta which weighs one third of the fetal weight on average. A viral search by COVID-19 PCR will be carried out on the placenta fragment and another part will be frozen for analysis by electron microscopy and study of the viral proteome, cytokines and immune mechanisms. Placenta samples will be frozen at -80 degrees."

              "BriefSummary":"This project seeks to test the efficacy of a brief eHealth intervention in an international randomized controlled trial (RCT) to increase COVID-19 knowledge and protective behaviors, and reduce psychological distress among LGBT people. This project involves enrolling racially diverse samples of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in three cities, randomizing 900 people (stratified among cisengender men, cisgender women, and transgender people) to either the immediate behavioral intervention or the waitlist control condition. Participants will complete a baseline survey, a follow-up survey 2 weeks post-intervention, and a final survey 2 months after the post-intervention survey. Primary outcomes are COVID-19 transmission knowledge, COVID-19 protective behaviors, and psychological distress.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) populations are at heightened vulnerability to COVID-19 due to existing health disparities amid adverse social determinants of health (SDOH), rights violations, and social-structural constraints on public health recommended (PHR) protective measures. Yet, public health responses largely do not address LGBT+ vulnerabilities nor do they include LGBT+ communities in pandemic response planning.\n\nAs there is no manualized intervention for COVID-19 prevention, the investigators will adapt an efficacious eHealth intervention for preventing HIV infection and transmission, the deadliest pandemic of the last century. This study builds on evidence-based eHealth interventions using Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Psychoeducation to increase health knowledge and behaviors, and reduce psychological distress, including interventions with LGBT+ people.\n\nMI is a client-centered counseling approach that elicits and strengthens intrinsic motivation for change. Psychoeducation integrates education and counseling to promote mental health. Peer counselors will receive 5 days of online training on COVID-19, PHR behaviors, pandemic stress (anxiety, depression, social isolation), MI-based counselling, psychoeducation, and research ethics. The 3 primary study outcomes are increasing COVID-19 knowledge, PHR protective behaviors, and reducing psychological distress; these are crucial elements of public health approaches to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\n#SafeHandsSafeHearts is a 3-session peer-delivered MI-based brief counselling (45 min-1 hr) with weekly individual sessions. Participants will be recruited online with electronic flyers and social media messages developed with community-based organization (CBO) partners, and distributed through CBO social media accounts and listservs in each of the three study sites (Toronto, Bangkok, Mumbai), and a study website. Participants will be randomized to the immediate intervention group or waitlist control group at a 1:1 ratio, stratified by sex and gender (cisgender men, cisgender women, transgender people), using a computer-generated sequence. All participants will complete a baseline survey, a post-intervention follow-up survey 2 weeks after completing the intervention, and a final survey 2 months after post-intervention survey.\n\nNOTE: Due to pandemic-related delays and lockdowns, and Toronto site approvals and opening 6-months prior to Bangkok and Mumbai, Toronto site is a pilot intervention to inform feasibility, acceptability, and implementation of the RCT; Bangkok and Mumbai sites remain RCTs."

Currently, two COVID-19 vaccines are available for vaccination in Europe through conditional marketing authorisation granted by the European Medicines Agency and further vaccine will be licensed. These vaccines have shown good vaccine efficacy in phase 3 vaccine trials. We will recruit subjects who will be prioritised for vaccination with the primary aim of comparing the immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination and natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Western Norway we have recruited cohorts of health care workers and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and will extend to COVID-19 vaccinees. Demographic, clinical data and repeated blood samples will be collected to evaluate the complications and kinetics, duration and breadth of the immune responses comparing natural infection to vaccination.",

              "BriefSummary":"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a helmet-like interface has been described as a safe strategy, with minimal contamination of the environment, improving the oxygenation of patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) by COVID-19, avoiding intubation in more than half of the cases. ELMOcpap, developed in Ceará, was a great ally in the treatment of these cases during the pandemic in the state. It is estimated that among public and private services, more than 1.400 ELMOs have been applied to patients with COVID-19. However, the determining factors of the success and failure of its use in the different institutions in which it has been applied are still unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to survey all data associated with the use of the device.\n\nObjectives: 1. To describe the effects of ELMO in the treatment of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 in a database, in a systematic and standardized way, on clinical history, efficacy, safety, modes, duration of use, the occurrence of adverse events and early predictors of failure. 2. Determine the intubation rate of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure who used the ELMO. 3. Identify the mortality rate of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 who used the ELMO.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study of recorded data from patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure who were treated with the ELMO. An online electronic form will be developed with REDCap, where the responsible investigator of each institution will be responsible for filling in the participants' data, ensuring adherence to the protocol and analysis will be carried out of the data of the patients of the participating services of the research that used the ELMO as treatment.",
              "DetailedDescription":"An online electronic form will be developed with REDCap, where the responsible investigator of each institution will be responsible for filling in the participants' data, ensuring adherence to the protocol.\n\nThe researchers involved will undergo qualified training and will receive a video, showing step-by-step how REDCap works, so that there are no doubts about the data collection process and to ensure the standardization of the collection protocol.\n\nAn explanation of the nature and objectives of the study will be presented to the research subjects, as well as its importance to society, health professionals and researchers.\n\nThe investigators will visit the hospital at least five times a week in the morning, afternoon and/or night shifts, for data collection, with monitoring and collection of outcomes being performed daily."

              "DetailedDescription":"The Covid-19 viral pandemic has caused significant global losses and disruption to all aspects of society (including health, education, and business and economic security). One of the major difficulties in controlling the spread of this coronavirus has been the delayed and mild (or lack of) presentation of symptoms in infected individuals. Moreover, there is insufficient Covid-19 testing capacity in the UK, and only moderate accuracy of such tests at confirming coronavirus infection. Together, these obstacles have led to countless unknown coronavirus cases going unobserved and fuelling the viral spread in the population, by compromising the stringency of self- isolation measures undertaken by infected individuals who may have otherwise curbed or prevented their transmission of the virus. The profound and widespread cost of the continuing Covid-19 progression, coinciding with the lack of testing capacity, warrants the development of alternative diagnostic tools that reliably assess Covid-19 infection in the early stages of infection, while also being low- cost, low-burden, and easily administered to a wide proportion of the population.\n\nThe free symptom-monitoring app 'Covid Symptom Study' was launched in mid-March by health technology start-up Zoe Global Ltd, and is currently being used in the UK, US and Sweden, with more than 2.7 million users in the UK alone who use the app to self-report their Covid-19 symptoms. Upon registering to use the app, users are asked to report demographic and phenotypic data such as age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, contact with infected individuals (through a healthcare professional capacity), smoking behaviour, existing health conditions, among other information. From then on, users are asked to report, on a daily basis, their presentation of symptoms attributable to Covid-19 (or lack thereof) through the use of app-administered questionnaires, thus enabling real-time tracking of disease progression across the UK. The app also allows users to report their Covid-19 test results, thus enabling the development of prediction algorithms based solely on self-reported user data to predict the presence of infection in untested users.\n\nOn behalf of Zoe Global Ltd, the UK Department of Health and Social Care with support from the UK's Chief Scientific Advisor has committed to test up to 10,000 app-users per week for infection with SARS-CoV-2 across England and Northern Ireland, for the purpose of rapidly improving the accuracy of symptom-based predictions. Similar testing allowance may follow in Scotland and Wales.\n\nSymptomatic app-users will be asked to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, using the popular swab and qRT-PCR technique, and asked to report their test results in the app, while continuing to log their symptoms.\n\nThis validation study, conducted at King's College London, aims to validate the sensitivity and specificity of machine learning models as a diagnostic tool that predicts infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on app-reported symptoms and phenotypic data, against the 'gold-standard' swab PCR-test, by utilising the Covid Symptom Study app as a research platform.\n\nIt is hypothesised that by training the symptom-based models using swab test results and through multiple model iterations following continuous data input from reporting and tested app users, predictions of infection will be made with considerable accuracy, thus enabling the Covid Symptom Study app to be used as a diagnostic tool that alleviates the strain of testing capacity in the UK while being easily accessible and posing low user burden.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nDue to the rapidly developing and uncertain duration and intensity of the Covid-19 pandemic, the present study design is prospective and one that enables regular iteration on prediction models and continuous accumulation of validation data. The study consists of a series of phases, each lasting 14 days. Before the start of each phase (day 0), a set of machine learning models will be frozen and submitted for validation on data collected during this and subsequent phases.\n\nMachine learning algorithms improve with increasing data. Therefore, validation phases will continue as long as tests are available and app users consent to joining the study. Due to the uncertainty around the progression of UK infection rates, the validation study will be continue whilst it is of value to public health.\n\nA detailed statistical analysis plan is described in the document attached to this record. A record of all machine learning models used for validation will be regularly updated on GitHub (https://github.com/zoe/covid-validation-study)."

We do not know the impact of this infection on patients suffering from MHM, nor the possible effect of specific treatment of MHM on the evolution of COVID-19.\n\nThis study will collect French IMD patients having or having had COVID-19 infection. The main objective is to estimate among IMD patients contracting COVID-19 the frequency of disease aggravation or metabolic decompensation.\n\nThe secondary objectives will be : a. to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 diagnosed in a given group of IMD when the number of patients with this IMD is known (Urea Cycle Deficiency, Gaucher Disease). b. to evaluate the impact of IMD on the and severity of COVID-19 infection"

              "BriefSummary":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially developed at the beginning of December 2019 in Whuan, Hubei province of China has spread all over the world. Beside the most common symptoms at onset of illness including fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia and dyspnoea, there are less common symptoms such as headache abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. The proportion of patients complaining gastrointestinal symptoms is variable between 3,4% and 17,0%. Interestingly, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) RNA has been reported to be detectable in 50% of patients' stool samples and in these patients around the 50% had diarrhoea.\n\nSARS-CoV2 transmission has been reported to be through droplets. However, mounting evidence indicates that SARS-CoV2 has a tropism for the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted with faeces. Accordingly, a faecal-oral route of transmission of the virus has been recently postulated. Indeed, SARS-CoV2 binds to host ACE 2 receptors (ACE2) to entry into cells which are abundantly expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and regulate intestinal inflammation. Taken together, this evidence could provide a rational basis for the development of gastrointestinal symptoms reported by COVID19 infected patients.\n\nPrimary aim: to evaluate the prevalence and prognosis of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients admitted to hospital for COVID19 disease Secondary aims\n\nto evaluate long term consequences of COVID-19 on gastrointestinal symptoms\nto evaluate long term consequences of COVID-19 on the development of post-infection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS)\nto evaluate long term consequences of COVID-19 on the development of post-infection dyspepsia\nto assess the clinical and laboratory predictors (risk factors) of post-infection gastrointestinal symptom development",
              "DetailedDescription":"The investigators propose a multicentre observational prospective study according to the clinical routine practice of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. All patients will be clinically evaluated at admission according to standard clinical practice. All data present in the inpatient medical record will be used for the study.\n\nThe study cohort will be composed by consecutively enrolled COVID19 confirmed inpatients (case group) and COVID19 negative patients hospitalized for other reasons (controls group) referred to the participants centres from May 1, 2020.\n\nPatient's follow up will start at discharge and will continue for 12 months.\n\nDefinitions Confirmed COVID19 cases The definitions of COVID19 state are according to the World Health Organization (WHO) document released in March 2020.\n\nA person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Patients categorized as suspect or probable COVID19 cases will be excluded from enrolment.\n\nCOVID19 negative patients (controls) Consecutive COVID19 negative in-patients admitted for any clinical condition other than a primary gastrointestinal disease fulfilling the inclusion criteria.\n\nVisits and evaluations After enrolment, all patients will be contacted telephonically at 1 month after discharge for reassessment of Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). Subsequently, patients will be contacted every 6 months for a total of 12 months. At telephonic evaluation at 6 and 12 months after discharge patients will undergo the GSRS questionnaire, the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Adults (R4DQ) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and thus the onset of PI-IBS will be recorded.\n\nData Management Data flow Data will be collected in custom electronic Case Report Forms (e-CRFs) on REDCap platform. System backups for data stored and records retention for the study data will be consistent with standard procedures.\n\nElectronic Case Report Forms eCRFs are to be completed using RedCAP system. Sites will receive training and a have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically and should be handled in accordance with instructions. All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.\n\nSafety of Electronic data Data will be collected in an ad hoc electronic record storage. The creation and the management of electronic record storage will be evaluated preliminarily with institution information technology staff. Data will be collected in REDCap platform. Redcap platform is an online platform maintained in a server that is propriety of the institution. Access and data transfer from and to REDCap platform are managed under https protocol and 128-bit encryption wit SSL certificate (a secure connection with encrypted data transfer). The access at the site is allowed only for the investigators and require a user-specific password of at least 8 characters including number and special character. Redcap comes with a system of user privileges, so only the account of the principal investigator has the authorization to explore the entire dataset. The sub-investigators and data manager have limited authorizations,and can see only data that they entered personally.

              "BriefSummary":"This 2-arm clustered, randomized community trial will test a multilevel, COVID-19 testing and linkage to care (eg, health insurance, medical appointments, community resources, contact tracing) intervention against a nontailored, attention-control condition on uptake of COVID-19 testing with adult African American church-affiliated members at 6 months. Contact tracing approval (beliefs and participation contact tracing) and COVID19 prevention behaviors will also be examined. Findings from this study could provide a theory-based, multilevel model for delivering scalable, wide-reaching COVID-19 testing and linkage to care services, including contact tracing, by supporting African American faith leaders with culturally-appropriate, easy-to-use tools and health agency partnerships.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The primary aim of this study is to conduct a two-arm clustered randomized controlled trial to fully test a multilevel, religiously-tailored African American church-based COVID19 testing and linkage to care (LTC) intervention (Tx) vs a nontailored multilevel, attention-control (AC) condition on COVID19 testing uptake (primary outcome) at 6 mos. LTC, contact tracing approval (CTA) and prevention behaviors (exploratory secondary outcomes) will also be examined with participants, adult African American church and community members. Churches will be matched on attendance size and denomination, and randomly assigned to Tx or AC. Previous HIV testing and diabetes prevention studies conducted in African American churches, whereby the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Socioecological Model will guide intervention design and delivery, will be adapted for this project. Using a community engaged approach, these models provide a theoretically-based, ecologically-expanded TBP framework for intervention delivery through multilevel church outlets to increase reach, dose, and impact. Sixteen churches (45 church members and 15 community members using outreach services per church; N= 960 total) have been project to be required to detect significant increases in testing.\n\nTrained church health workers will deliver the Tx intervention during existing, multilevel church activities using a culturally-tailored COVID19 Tool Kit inclusive of digital tools consisting of: a) individual self-help materials and automated/tailored text messages; b) virtual supportive group seminars about COVID19; c) virtual/in-person church services with COVID19 related materials/activities (e.g., sermons, pastors modeling testing, testimonials, bulletins); and d) church-community level COVID19 testing and LTC services (e.g., healthcare, prevention programs, community resources, contact tracing) provided virtually by community health workers. All churches will host COVID19 testing events. First, a pilot study site will be used to test project feasibility followed by the 16 RCT faith-based study sites. Social, ethical, behavioral implications (SEBI) data will also be collected. All data will be made available to the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Underserved Populations (RADxUP) Data Consortium.\n\nSpecific Aims (SA):\n\nSA 1. Test a tailored TPB-guided multilevel, COVID19 intervention against a nontailored AC arm on uptake of COVID19 testing, and LTC/CTA & prevention behaviors with African American church-populations at 6 months.\n\nHypothesis: The tailored, TPB testing/LTC intervention will attain higher testing rates than AC at 6 months.\n\nSA 2. Evaluate roles of potential mediators and moderators related to COVID19 testing among church-affiliated African Americans at 6 months to determine modifiable facilitators/barriers.\n\nSA 3. Conduct a process evaluation to understand study implementation facilitators, barriers, and fidelity; and examine relationships between implementation, intervention dose and exposure, and intervention outcomes to identify and improve essential intervention components.\n\nSignificance: This novel study is the first to fully test a COVID19 testing and LTC intervention in African American churches. It could provide a theory-based, multilevel model for delivering scalable, wide-reaching COVID19 testing and LTC by supporting African American faith leaders with culturally-appropriate, easy-to-use tools and health agency partnerships. It could have a major impact on uptake of COVID19 testing, inform on LTC and contact tracing, and streamline future vaccine delivery in African American communities hard hit by COVID19."

On May 7, 2020, there were 75 deaths at the CHRO hospital in Orleans, excluding EHPAD. The contamination rate of the population of the Loiret department has been estimated at 5.6% of the population by Public Health France. This rate is very low and does not allow the use of serological screening tests because of too many false positives or false negatives, there should be a prevalence of the disease greater than 60%. The French health authorities do not recommend the use of a screening test at the present time in view of the uncertainties of the results of this test. The Loiret Management Center, the Department and Orléans Métropole have decided to offer a covid-19 serological screening test, the covid-19 presto test, to voluntary territorial agents regardless of their return to work following the national \"deconfinement \"on May 11, 2020 This can only be done through an epidemiological surveillance study validated as part of a research protocol."

              "BriefSummary":"The main objective of this study is to assess if analysis of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) can provide useful prognostic markers for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute respiratory insufficiency among patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, to give a characterization of the lung damage caused by COVID-19 by analysis of daily blood samples.\n\nThe hypothesis is that the protein content of the EBC from COVID-19 patients who require admission to the ICU differs from the EBC from COVID-19 patients with uncomplicated hospitalization, potentially providing diagnostic markers of COVID-19 related pulmonary damage.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Two EBC samples will be collected from each study participant; a baseline sample (at admission) and a sample at either hospital discharge or transfer to the ICU. In addition, blood samples will be collected in order to investigate the pathophysiology of COVID-19 using metabolomics analysis, and for standardization and validation of the putative markers from the EBC.\n\nThe investigators will collect EBC from COVID-19 positive patients acutely admitted to Aalborg University Hospital due to COVID-19 symptoms and compare the protein and metabolite profiles in patients, who are treated at the ward with patients, who are transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation. The main-outcome (i.e. means of the relative amounts of specific proteins in the EBC samples) will be compared by unpaired t-tests after assessment of normality and standard deviations within the two groups in the following comparison: EBC collected at admission (baseline) from patients who did not need mechanical ventilation vs. EBC at admission from patients who did need mechanical ventilation. Paired t-tests will compare the proteins in baseline EBC samples and samples at either transfer to the ICU intubation or discharge to home in order to describe the pathophysiology in the two groups (no ICU need versus need of ICU admission). The investigators will not collect EBC from patients admitted to the ICU for open-circuit respiratory support, e.g. high-flow oxygenation; these patients will be asked to give an EBC sample before discharge, like the patients who did not need ICU care.\n\nA blood sample will be drawn at the two days of EBC collection (i.e. a 9 mL tube drawn along with routine work-up blood samples) from the study participants for two purposes: 1) Standardization of the putative markers and verification and supplementing analysis of the EBC markers. In order to qualify the most suitable markers and substrates for standardization, the analysis of the EBC samples must be completed before the blood samples can be analyzed. Conventional biochemical analysis will be used for this purpose. 2) Pathophysiological description of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using metabolomics and proteomics analysis. No genetic analysis will be conducted on the stored blood samples.\n\nAfter collection of the EBC, the samples will be stored directly in the collection tube marked with study subject id at -80⁰C. The EBC samples will be used solely for the subsequent analysis of the protein composition (i.e. proteomics) and metabolites (i.e. metabolomics).\n\nThe collection of EBC will not lead to deviations from standard diagnostic procedures or treatments. The patients will have routine blood samples drawn as a part of the diagnostic work-up and daily disease monitoring. The investigators will ask for consent to draw an extra 9 mL blood sample along with the routine blood samples at the two days of EBC collection."

              "BriefSummary":"Background and Objective Persistent symptoms after COVID 19 episodes (or referred to as Long COVID) can appear at a certain period and affect the quality of life of the patients, as well as introduce other comorbidities. It is important to address the associated factors of persistent symptoms after the COVID 19 episode. By identifying these factors, a screening method could be deployed to detect individuals that are prone to persistent COVID 19 symptoms.\n\nMethod:\n\nThis cohort study recruit COVID 19 patients at all stages in Indonesia (including people who underwent home isolation). Patient-based clinical information is collected from the patient including the demographic information, general health status, COVID 19 vaccination, and COVID 19 treatment. The outcome is the occurrence of persistent COVID 19-related symptoms after being declared as cured. A logistic regression model and Cox Regression are applied to the model to find the associated factors. Machine learning and Deep Learning model will be constructed and deployed into a web-based application for a further screening program.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThere is an association between duration of COVID episode, repeated COVID episode, and the presence of persistent COVID 19 Symptoms\nVaccinated individual who was infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (COV2) will have less persistent COVID 19 symptoms\nIndividuals with comorbidities are prone to persistent COVID 19 Symptoms\nAppropriate medications (including early administration of antiviral therapy) lead to a lower probability of persistent COVID 19 Symptoms",

Prospective evaluation of lung abnormalities and pulmonary fibrosis after COVID-19 infection is crucial as novel treatments against lung fibrosis of different etiologies are available. No data on pulmonary longterm effects in COVID-19 survivors are currently available. The nation-wide Swiss COVID-19 lung group establishes a meticulously characterized prospective cohort study on pulmonary long-term sequela of patients living in Switzerland."

Subjects will either receive two immunizations with a low dosage vaccine (Cohort A), two immunization with a high dosage vaccine (Cohort B), a single immunization with the high dosage vaccine (Cohort C) or placebo (randomized to all three cohorts).\n\nAs safety precaution, the study will begin with the enrolment of a small group of 6 sentinel subjects (2 Sentinel Groups, three subjects each of cohorts A and B) each of whom will receive the vaccine on days 0 and 28 in an unblinded and non-randomized manner.\n\nThereafter, 84 remaining participants will be enrolled in a double-blinded, randomized manner into one of the three cohorts (A, B or C). Placebo will be applied to blind the different regimen.\n\nAfter the screening visit, participants will be expected to return to the investigational clinical site for 8 visits (9 for the sentinel groups) up to day 91 for immunogenicity sample collection and up to day 210 for safety assessments.\n\nSamples for measles shedding will be collected from subjects of the Sentinel Groups (unblinded regiment in cohort A and B). Body fluids including saliva, nasal swab, urine and whole blood will be collected from day 0 up to day 42.\n\nThe investigator and site personnel assessing Adverse Events (AEs), all participants, as well as the sponsor's representatives involved in the monitoring and conduct of the study will be unblinded to which vaccine was administered within the unblinded treatment phase. Only the site personnel performing randomization, preparation and administration of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be unblinded within the randomized double-blinded treatment phase."

              "DetailedDescription":"BACKGROUND:\n\nPreliminary observational data collected by Otorhinolaryngologist at the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza and by literature evidenced that numerous patients suffering from Sars-CoV-2 infection had smell and taste disorders. The are many data in the literature but few validated studies are available. Furthermore, it is not yet known in these patients what factors are related to the presence of olfactory and gustatory symptoms.\n\nThe aim of the study is to identify the demographic and clinical factors related to the smell and taste disorders in patients with Sars-CoV-2 infection, to evaluate the evolution of symptoms with a follow-up and to evaluate which factors influence the improvement of that symptoms.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN:\n\nThe study will include patients diagnosed with Sars-CoV-2 infection who have been hospitalized in the COVID wards of the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza and non-hospitalized patients but that get access to the \"nasopharyngeal swabs\" service of the hospital for the detection of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.\n\nThe study includes 3 timepoints. After acquiring informed consent, patient will be contacted on the phone and he will be asked to answer a multiple or short-answer questionnaire (T0) aimed at collecting demographic and clinical data, in particular relating to the smell and taste disorders, which will take place approximately 24 hours after running the swab. Follow-up period will follow, which will require patients to be contacted and invited by the Investigator to repeat the telephone questionnaire respectively 1 month (T1) and 3 months (T2) from the first compilation (T0).\n\nThe following information will be collected and recorded on a paper CRF:\n\nregistry collection (date of birth, gender at birth)\norigin of the subjects: hospitalized, not hospitalized\npathological, pharmacological history, allergies, smoking, flu vaccination\ndate of onset of COVID19 symptoms\nsmell and taste symptoms and temporal correlation with systemic symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, headache, rhinitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgias, skin manifestations)\ndate of regression of the smell and taste symptoms\n\nSTATISCAL ANALYSIS:\n\nA logistic regression model is used to identify what the clinical and demographic factors associated with the onset of the disease of interest are.\n\nThe composite endpoint consisting of the presence of smell and / or taste disorders vs the absence of both pathologies will be used as a variable. The secondary analyzes will concern only the subjects who have declared that they have had the disease in the study and, through a logistic or ordinal regression model, we will try to identify which factors are associated with the positive evolution of the disease at T3 compared to T0."

International data are very limited, we have no robust estimates of incidence and no UK-based data with which to inform policy, clinical care, service delivery or advice to pregnant women.\n\nThe research aims are to investigate the three mains ways in which COVID-19 might affect newborns and babies that need neonatal care:\n\nNewborn babies might catch COVID-19 before, during or soon after birth and this may lead to problems with breathing or feeding that need support in hospital.\nCOVID-19 could affect babies that are already on neonatal units with other medical conditions (like being very premature) that place them at greater risk of severe COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 might affect that way that pregnant women are looked after in pregnancy, labour or bith which could lead to problems for some babies, even if they do not themselves become infected with COVID-19.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The investigators have established a national (UK-wide) active surveillance study using the standard British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) approach.\n\nSince the 1st April 2020 case notifications are being collected using the BPSU 'orange eCard' approach. Eligible babies are: neonatal COVID-19 in babies (<29 days old) in neonatal units, paediatric intensive care units and other in-patient locations and where neonates are born to COVID-19 mothers and require neonatal care. Notification cards are being sent weekly rather than the usual monthly pattern, this is so we are able to monitor case returns in 'real-time'. When paediatricians notify a case they are sent a data collection sheet which is returned complete to the BPSU-COVID-19 team at the NPEU.\n\nThe primary data collected in the study will also be cross-linking with data from: a parallel NIHR funded study of COVID-19 mothers being carried out using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS); MBRRACE-UK, the national surveillance of perinatal deaths; the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet); and PHE England, PHS Scotland, PHS Wales and the HSC Public Health Agency Northern Ireland. This is to ensure complete case ascertainment. A later linkage will be carried out with the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) in order to collect more detailed clinical information.\n\nAs data are weekly reports of the findings will be generated to inform the development of policy and practice. The findings will be sent together with the UKOSS findings to: the decision makers responsible for the COVID-19 control policy at NHSE, DHSC, the Scottish, Welsh and NI governments, as well as the Royal Colleges of Paediatrics and Child Health and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCPCH & RCOG respectively), and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM). This will ensure that policy, advice to pregnant women and parents and guidance for practice benefits from the most up to date information.\n\nFollow-up at 3 months post-notification will be carried out in order to collect the final outcomes for each baby as the first data collection will be completed when a substantial proportion of babies will still be in-patients.\n\nData will also be shared (subject to appropriate approvals and data sharing agreements) with the COVID-19 registries that are being developed in the UK and across Europe."

The virus quickly spread to other countries and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By March 2021, many nations and organizations embarked on finding a cure or vaccine for this devastating viral infection. The Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was the first to obtain emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) on December 11, 2020, followed by the Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine on December 18, 2020, and the Janssen COVID-19 viral vector vaccine on February 27, 2021. The mRNA vaccines and the viral vector vaccine are designed based on the spike protein of SARS-COV-2. These vaccines had been administered to millions of Americans prior to July 2021.",
              "DetailedDescription":"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) was identified as the agent that caused an outbreak of pneumonia (termed COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The virus quickly spread to other countries and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By March 2021, many nations and organizations embarked on finding a cure or vaccine for this devastating viral infection. The Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was the first to obtain emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) on December 11, 2020, followed by the Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine on December 18, 2020, and the Janssen COVID-19 viral vector vaccine on February 27, 2021. The mRNA vaccines and the viral vector vaccine are designed based on the spike protein of SARS-COV-2. These vaccines had been administered to millions of Americans prior to July 2021.\n\nSimilar to other infections that are preventable with vaccination, COVID-19 vaccination is not a SARS-CoV-2 infection panacea. However, in fully vaccinated people the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, severe illness, and death from COVID-19 is relatively less. Viruses may escape the host immune defense through mutations that create new variants of the primary virus. Some variants emerge and disappear while others persist and may have properties that may be different from the primary virus. By late 2020, a new variant, the delta variant, was identified in Maharashtra, India. This variant is highly transmissible and causes infections even in fully vaccinated people, it is less sensitive to neutralizing antibodies from recovered subjects and less sensitive to vaccine-induced antibodies, and there is evidence that it causes more severe infections. While the world was trying to contain and control the spread of the delta variant, the WHO reported a new variant of COVID-19, omicron. It was detected in late November 2021 in specimens collected in Botswana and South Africa. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge and the world continues to seek means of controlling the pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that the population ratios who have received a full series of COVID-19 vaccination from Pfizer, Moderna, or Janssen as of February 2, 2022 is 17.46/11.25/1. Furthermore, more of those who received the Janssen COVID-19 viral vector vaccine have preferred and received an mRNA vaccine booster. Unfortunately, the CDC data lacks the booster dose data for Texas residents.\n\nThe FDA in collaboration with the CDC makes decision on when a booster is recommended. This decision is based on many factors including the level of antibodies and memory cells post-COVID-19 vaccination and infection. There is much evidence that decreasing the COVID-19 spike antibodies titer and memory cells may increase the likelihood of a breakthrough COVID-19 infection. Unfortunately, there isn't a prior report or study comparing the incidence of COVID-19 infection among people fully vaccinated with any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines. This study seeks to find a relationship between the last dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in a fully vaccinated person and a COVID-19 breakthrough infection. The study will also find a correlation between the duration from a booster dose to the diagnosis of a breakthrough COVID-19 infection."

              "BriefSummary":"The objectives of this research is to:\n\nAssess perceptions, concerns, and practices related to the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation strategies using the MURDOCK Study Community Registry and Biorepository population as a measure of these features in Cabarrus County through a biweekly electronic survey.\nEstimate the prevalence and change in prevalence of COVID-19 infection based on responses to questionnaire items on symptoms and practices using a biweekly electronic survey.\nAmong respondents to the baseline questionnaire, conduct at home mid-turbinate nasal swab collection for viral PCR testing for active COVID-19 infection as an estimate of the prevalence of active infection in Cabarrus County.\nAmong respondents to the baseline questionnaire, conduct serologic testing for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as an estimate of the prevalence of exposure and potential immunity to COVID-19.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Method:\n\nQuestionnaire The investigators will use RedCap to introduce the study, obtain online informed consent, and administer an electronic questionnaire to MURDOCK Study participants currently residing in North Carolina who have a valid email address on file (N~7200). The question bank for the questionnaire is attached to the application. It includes demographics, education and employment, and questions about symptoms, contacts and exposures, the participant's household, behaviors, and practice of mitigation strategies. The opportunity to enroll and complete the baseline questionnaire will remain open for 1 month. Follow up surveys will be made available to consented participants on the same day for each week they are administered. The investigators anticipate a 20% response rate to the survey (N~1500). Recruitment materials, consent and questionnaires, materials related to return of results to participants, and verbal study communications will be available in both English and Spanish.\n\nCOVID-19 PCR testing A randomly selected subset of individuals who consent to participate (N~300-500 initially, with the potential to expand testing to more survey participants as additional funding becomes available), weighted to ensure representation by race/ethnicity, age, and sex, will be invited to participate in COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral testing by at-home collection and return of self-administered nasal swabs. Saliva specimens may replace the nasal swab specimen. Specimens will be collected at baseline and every 2 weeks in conjunction with questionnaire administration. Participants will have the opportunity to opt out of participation in this component at the time of consent and enrollment. Those who do not opt out will be eligible for the random selection for COVID-19 testing. The investigators will provide specimen collection materials and instructions for collection, along with return shipping instructions to participants in pre-prepared kits. COVID-19 PCR testing will be conducted at the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health. This is a CLIA-certified laboratory. Samples for COVID-19 PCR testing will be identified only by a unique study identification number for each participant. Results of COVID-19 testing will be returned from the State Lab to the MURDOCK Study investigative team as results are available from testing (expected turnaround time ~4 days from receipt at State Lab) by secure transfer for incorporation into the RedCap study database.\n\nCOVID-19 serology testing The same randomly selected subset of individuals who collect at-home samples for COVID-19 PCR testing (N~300-500 initially, with the potential expand to more survey participants as additional resources become available), will also provide a blood sample for serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Specimens will be collected by routine venipuncture at the MURDOCK Study office in Kannapolis, NC and potentially 2-3 additional locations in Cabarrus County. Study visits for venipuncture will be deferred for 2 weeks in participants whose nasal swab PCR testing for COVID-19 is positive. Participants will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms at the time of scheduling the visit for venipuncture and at arrival for the visit. Participants who screen positive for COVID-19 symptoms will be referred for clinical COVID-19 testing and will have their initial serology testing deferred until a negative clinical test is documented or for 2 weeks if clinical testing is not performed.\n\nSpecimens for serology will be collected at baseline approximately 1 month after the first questionnaire and 2 weeks after the first nasal swab collection and COVID-19 PCR testing. Specimens for serology will be collected at least bi-monthly and up to monthly thereafter through a total study duration of 6, and up to 12, months. SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing for IgG antibodies will be conducted in the laboratory of Thomas Denny, MSc, MPhil in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute on the campus of Duke University Medical Center using a commercial IgG assay (Perkin-Elmer). Samples for serology will be identified only by a unique study identification number for each participant. Results of serological testing will be returned from the Denny laboratory to the MURDOCK Study investigative team at regular, prespecified intervals by secure transfer for incorporation into the RedCap study database. The Denny laboratory is CLIA-certified. Any residual serum after SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing will be frozen at -80°C and stored for future use in the Duke COVID-19 Biorepository (Pro00105316).\n\nReturn of Results to Participants:\n\nThe investigators will share aggregate results from questionnaires and testing with all participants and the public through multiple routes, including email, social media and the press and with the scientific community through presentations at scientific meetings and publications. The investigators will also provide regular reports on accruing study data to NCDHHS. Participants will not be identified individually in these aggregate reports. The investigators also will return the results of both COVID-19 PCR testing and serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to individual study participants. Individual return of results will follow the following principles:\n\nCOVID-19 test results. A standard template for return of negative COVID-19 test results will be IRB approved and used to notify participants of their results. If a participant tests positive for COVID-19, the participant will be contacted by phone by the study PI or a designate to convey the result. General recommendations for participants who test positive will be IRB approved. The investigators will also offer these participants a link through which they can consider participation in the Duke COVID Community Watch support program (Pro00105189). Positive COVID-19 test results will also be reported to the local/state health department.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 serology results. An IRB approved standard template will be used to convey the results of SARS-CoV-2 serology to participants. Care will be taken to ensure that participants understand what information the results of their SARS-CoV-2 serology conveys (and does not convey) in order to avoid any risk of misinterpretation, particularly of positive results.\n\nSelection of Subjects\n\nList inclusion/exclusion criteria and how subjects will be identified. The MURDOCK NCDHHS COVID-19 Prevalence Study will examine COVID-19 prevalence and SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in Cabarrus County, NC by leveraging the community-based cohort enrolled in the MURDOCK Study Community Registry and Biorepository (MURDOCK Study). The MURDOCK Study is an ongoing longitudinal health study operated by the Translational Population Health Research Center in the Duke Clinical & Translational Science Institute and approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board (Duke IRB Pro00011196). The MURDOCK Study recruited 12,526 residents from 20 Zip Codes in the Cabarrus County/Kannapolis region, and currently follows 10,407 active participants. As part of the MURDOCK Study, all participants provided demographic, clinical, and behavioral data via an enrollment questionnaire, were geospatially mapped at the street address level, and consented to a yearly follow up questionnaire. They also provided consent to be contacted by MURDOCK Study staff up to four times per year to consider participation in future research opportunities. A recent protocol communication to the IRB was approved to allow additional contacts for high priority COVID-19 research studies (Pro00011196-SE-45.0). Our study population for this protocol will include approximately 7200 active MURDOCK Study participants who currently reside in North Carolina and have a valid email address on file. The active study participants who receive a recruitment email and consent to participate (estimated 20%) will have the opportunity to declare their interest in testing and from among those 300-500 will be randomly selected to participate in the testing. The anticipated number to enroll is set at 1,000 but may be adjusted up based on response rate."

This test will be developed using innovative technology developed at the Parc Taulí University Hospital, which increases the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 differential antigens. The increased immunogenicity of these antigens will allow to detect, with a high sensitivity and specificity, the antibodies in the serum of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This test will serve to confirm dubious results as well as reduce false negatives from the PCR test, which will ultimately help reduce transmission of the infection."

              "DetailedDescription":"Covid-19 infections demonstrated a pandemic spread after January 2020 and their associations with patient characteristics and comorbidities are intensely studied. Investigators also want to find out potential relations between major medications taken for chronic diseases and clinical parameters of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia.\n\nFor the study, investigators will recruit patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia between March 11th, 2020 (the date at which the first case of Covid-19 in Turkey officially declared) and April 15th, 2020 in emergency, internal medicine and cardiology outpatient clinics, retrospectively. All of the demographic features, complaints on admission, reports of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest without intravenous contrast issued by the staff radiologist, c-reactive protein (CRP) and complete blood count (CBC) values on admission will be recorded retrospectively. Their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results will be derived from the hospital records based on public health covid-19 database notifications and list of medications taken regularly for more than 8 weeks before the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia from the national pharmacy database. Information about other systemic diseases and major medical conditions of patients will be procured from the medical histories gained by relevant physicians. Patient taking each drug group will be compared to those not taking that drugs in terms of clinical and demographical features mentioned above. Statistical analysis will be performed by using SPSS software."

              "BriefSummary":"The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a worldwide health emergency. To contain the spread of disease, high demands on testing availability and capacity are observed. Although polymerase chain reaction (PRC) is the golden standard method in detecting infection with COVID-19, the procedure is time consuming and requires healthcare personnel and laboratories. Rapid antigen tests, however, have several potential benefits including greater scalability and results are provided much quicker. So far, sampling for rapid antigen tests is predominantly performed by health care personnel. Though, the testing and analyzing procedure of an antigen test seems manageable by laymen but the validity of a self-performed rapid antigen test is sparsely examined. Thus, the investigators wish to conduct a study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of self-performed rapid antigen test for detecting COVID-19 infection by comparing self-performed and healthcare-performed rapid antigen tests on the same individual while using a PCR tests as a control.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Background:\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic continue to be a worldwide health emergency resulting in national lockdown.\n\nA strategy for the opening of society has been proposed to be extensive testing.\n\nThe golden standard for correct detection of SARS-CoV-2 is by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of an upper respiratory specimen. However, this requires laboratory facilities and the test is time-consuming. Rapid antigen tests offer a simpler approach, and test results are available within minutes. Especially the latter can potentially lead to a faster containment of infection in the society. So far, the specimens for the rapid antigen test have primarily been collected by nasopharyngeal swabs by trained personnel.\n\nSelf-collected swab offers a possibility to increase testing access and would enable testing outside the healthcare system. Furthermore, self-collected swabs could lower the exposure risk of healthcare workers and could reduce the expenses for personal protective equipment, and lastly self-collection is furthermore reported as the preferred sampling method. However, self-collected swabs may pose issues of increased risk of incorrect sampling as sampling is unsupervised and the sensitivity of the self-collected tests compared to professional-collected tests has been questioned due to varying results. Studies on the rapid antigen test and self-collected swabs as a screening tool are sparse.\n\nThe aim of the study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of self-testing for SARS-CoV-2 to a test performed by trained personnel. Both the self-collected and the collection by trained personnel will be two independent SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (Standard Q COVID-19 Ag - test, SD Biosensor INC.) by sampling from both the anterior part of the nose as well as the oropharynx. The diagnostic accuracy of the two antigen tests will furthermore be compared to a RT-PCR test based on a swab from the oropharynx.\n\nMethod\n\nStudy design:\n\nThe project is a comparative, prospective, randomized, diagnostic accuracy study.\n\nParticipants:\n\nCitizens who have booked an appointment and show up for a COVID-19 test at Test Center, Valby, in the Capital Region are offered to participate in the project on a volunteer basis.\n\nIn Denmark, citizens are tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2 by swabs in the oropharynx, and subsequent analysis of the specimens by a RT-PCR test. The results of the swabs are given within 48 hours. The sampling procedure is performed by trained personnel. The oropharyngeal swab is a swab of the palatine tonsils and the posterior wall of the pharynx examined by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nInterventions:\n\nParticipants will, in addition to the oropharyngeal swab they are already scheduled for, be examined by swabs from the anterior part of the nose, both performed by self-collection and by a trained personnel. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the order of the collection method from the sampling from the anterior part of the nose, respectively self-collection and collection by trained personnel.\n\nThe swabs from the anterior part of the nose and the oropharynx are analyzed by a rapid antigen test (Standard Q COVID-19 Ag - test, produced by SD Biosensor INC.). The swab of the anterior part of the nose is inserted approximately 1 inch/2 cms or until resistance in both nostrils with the same swab and are examined immediately after collection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oropharyngeal sampling is performed by collecting specimen from the posterior wall of the oropharynx and both tonsils using a swab. This sample is analyzed alike the rapid antigen test from the anterior part of the nose. Participants are instructed in the self-sampling by means of written instructions and have the opportunity to see a tutorial video accessed by a QR-code.\n\nThe results of the swabs will be available within 15 minutes and participants will be able to see the results electronically.\n\nThe participants are registered by the Region's test staff in a secure web database (REDCap) on-site and are asked to fill out an online survey regarding information on their symptoms and vaccination status.\n\nThe leftover material of the antigen tests is afterward placed in separate tubes with virus inactivating preservation transport media. SAll samples meant for RT-PCR analysis are sent to the test facility at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing targeting two segments of the Nuceloprotein gene. Analysis results are electronically transferred to Department of Clinical Microbiology at Rigshospitalet that is responsible for the interpretation and reporting of the final result to the participant.\n\nClinical outcome:\n\nThe investigators will define a participant with an RT-PCR positive result as having a COVID-19 infection and this will be the diagnostic reference standard to calculate the accuracy for the self-collected rapid antigen test. The criteria for a positive RT-PCR test result will be a cycle threshold (Ct) value below 34 for at least one gene-targets for SARS-CoV2. .\n\nSample size:\n\nBased on previous studies the investigators expect that the sampling performed by trained personnel have a 5% higher sensitivity than self-sampling. The investigators estimate that a sample of 1225 participants would provide the trial with an 80% power at a 5% significance level. The investigators thus wish to include a total of 8000 participants. The prevalence of COVID-19 in Denmark is currently approximately 9.3%, thus the investigators expect to have approximately 700 COVID-19 positive patients.\n\nRandomization sequence:\n\nThe randomization is generated by a computer program (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists). Participants are randomized at enrollment in block sizes of 40 participants. This table with randomization numbers is only available to specified personnel at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery and Audiology, Rigshospitalet.\n\nStatistics:\n\nThe investigators wish to calculate the sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence interval of the self-collected rapid antigen test with reference to a rapid antigen test collected by healthcare. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection by the two rapid antigen test collection methods will be compared using McNemar's test. The level of statistical significance is p < 0.05.\n\nThe research group:\n\nThe research group at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery and Audiology, Rigshospitalet, led by professor, Christian von Buchwald, MD., has already substantial experience in COVID-19 research, including a well-discussed study regarding the effectiveness of facial masks and a study on sensitivity of self-collective swabs, in addition to ongoing projects on impaired sense of smell and COVID-19 infection among hospital staff. The research group has recently performed a large study on the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen test with swabs collected in the nasopharynx. This project will be a collaboration with a private provider, Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services. The private provider in Denmark of SD Biosensor INC., Copenhagen Medical, will provide rapid antigen tests for the collection of the rapid antigen tests.\n\nPractical aspects of the project:\n\nTestcenter Danmark will provide the staff required for collecting swabs for RT-PCR tests at their test sites in the Capital Region and will deliver the results from here.\n\nIn addition, an agreement has been made with Copenhagen Medical who will deliver the rapid antigen test (Standard Q COVID-19 Ag - test, produced by SD Biosensor INC.) to the test centers where the project is carried out.\n\nEthical considerations:\n\nThe project will provide essential knowledge regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the possibility of self-testing for COVID-19 by rapid antigen test, as an alternative to healthcare collected tests, during the current pandemic in Europe. If the sensitivity of the quick tests is high, and a more widely use is implemented, it can potentially lead to a faster containment of the COVID-19 infection in the society.\n\nParticipation in the project might be associated with a small amount of discomfort due to the collection of specimens, but no greater discomfort than otherwise associated with swabs for COVID-19. As the patients already have booked an appointment for COVID-19 testing it is expected that participants will agree with this and the investigators are thus expecting a high participation rate. There are no known risks associated with participation in the project.\n\nThe protocol complies with the Declaration of Helsinki II. Furthermore, the project is approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee.\n\nRecruitment of participants and informed consent:\n\nAll patients older at the age of 16 years or older, who have booked an appointment for COVID-19 test, at Testcenter Danmark's test centers in the Capital Region are offered to participate in the project.\n\nThe participants will receive oral and written information about the project, as well as written information about subjects' rights. The right to bring a counsel to the information interview will likewise be explained.\n\nThe information interview is carried out by the staff from the Capital Region. Patients are offered 24 hours reflection time if needed before written consent is obtained. The participants are informed that they can withdraw their consent at any time without the affection of further processes or potential treatment.\n\nPatients' physical and mental integrity as well as privacy:\n\nEach participant is required to give written informed consent before he/she can be included in the study. Information obtained about participants' health, other purely private matters, and other confidential information is covered by professional secrecy.\n\nFurthermore, patients are covered by the Health Service´s \"Lov om klage- og erstatningsadgang\".\n\nSide effects, risks and disadvantages for patients:\n\nThe procedures performed in the project are already performed in detection of COVID-19 infection, and do not involve any known risks of side effects. There may be discomfort associated with the collection of the swab itself, in addition, there is a minor inconvenience for the patients in terms of the time they will have to spend on examination. However, the participants will be citizens who already have booked an appointment for COVID-19 test, and it is therefore expected that they agree with the discomfort or waiting time.\n\nClinical information from patient records:\n\nAge of the participants, the reason for the booking of appointment at one of Testcenter Denmark's test sites, as well as the results from the PCR test and the rapid antigen test will be registered for all trial participants.\n\nOperating expenses and financial conditions:\n\nNo members of the research group behind the project have financial interests in the execution or results of the project. The test staff who are to carry out the swabs for RT-PCT testing are part of Testcenter Danmark's staff and are paid from here. The rapid antigen tests are made available without payment by the distributor (Copenhagen Medical), however they have no role in the design of the project, nor the interpretation of the data.\n\nApplication for funding is not planned, but should economical support be obtained anyway, this will be deposited in a foundation account under the Foundation Administration at Rigshospitalet, which is under the hospital's audit.\n\nThe Scientific Ethics Committees will be informed and the participant information updated if funding is obtained.\n\nInterruption of the experiment:\n\nThe trial will be discontinued in the exceptional circumstances where it is impossible to complete the experiment. Likewise, extraordinary events that render the project incomplete in its entirety will lead to withdrawal for all ongoing trials participants.\n\nPerspectives:\n\nIf the sensitivity of the rapid antigen tests is reliable, this may lead to a more widely use of the rapid antigen tests in detection of COVID-19 infection in Denmark. As the response time of the rapid antigen tests is significantly faster than the PCR examinations, it can potentially lead to a faster containment of infection, and thus a better opportunity to bring COVID-19 infection in Denmark under control."

              "BriefSummary":"This multicentre prospective study will enroll a sufficient number of patients to afford approximately 60 positives and > 40 negatives (as determined by the SOC - Comparator method) in the United States and/or Canada. One to three sites in the United States and/or Canada will participate over an approximate 12-week enrolment period. The actual enrolment period will be dependent upon prevalence of Covid-19. Once positives sample size is achieved, expected SARC-CoV-2 negative subjects will be permitted.\n\nThis study is observational and will not impact the medical management of the patient. The results of the Spartan Test will be blinded to the clinical staff during the study and will not impact the medical management of the subject.\n\nOnce informed consent is obtained and eligibility is confirmed, subject demographics, and patient reported COVID-19 symptoms will be recorded. For the purposes of this study, enrolment will be defined as the collection of the two study-specific nasopharyngeal (NP) samples for Spartan's Test. Each patient's active involvement in the study will last for approximately 30 minutes.\n\nTo support the EUA, a minimum of 30 individual natural positive clinical specimens will be collected from patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a healthcare provider in COVID-19 disease endemic regions in the United States. Additionally, a minimum of 30 individual negative samples will also be used to support the EUA from patients in the United States.\n\nOnce subjects are consented and recruited for the study, three nasopharyngeal samples for each patient will be collected by trained operators at the clinical site. The first sample will be tested at the clinical site according to standard of care protocols currently in place for the sites' nasopharyngeal swab-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. The second nasopharyngeal sample will be tested at the site using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System. The third nasopharyngeal sample will be tested using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System only when the test conducted with the second nasopharyngeal swab does not produce a positive or negative result.\n\nThe sample for the SOC test will be collected prior to the samples for the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System as per clinical regulations."

              "DetailedDescription":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects multiple organ systems and imparts significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Approximately 5% to 14% of patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 will become critically ill [2-4]. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) generally begins as a respiratory tract infection, it can damage any organ system. Thus, to improve outcomes, clinicians should search actively for multi-organ involvement to guide appropriate early management [5].\n\nAmong affected organs, the kidney is particularly susceptible to COVID-19. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to share the same functional receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with a wide variety of organs (such as lung, heart, kidney) [6]. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its infection process by binding to functional receptors on the membrane of a host cell. Postmortem examination of COVID-19 patients revealed varying degrees of acute tubular necrosis, lymphocytic infiltration, and viral RNA, suggesting direct invasion of kidney tubules [7]. In addition to direct kidney damage by the virus, acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur through several proposed mechanisms including acute tubular necrosis induced by sepsis, hypoxia, hypoperfusion, rhabdomyolysis, nephrotoxic drugs, etc.\n\nIn critically ill patients, AKI is a common complication of COVID-19 infection, occurring in 23% to 43% of cases, and was correlated with poor clinical outcomes. AKI was defined as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria: a change in the serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL over 48 h period or 50% increase in baseline creatinine.\n\nAn increase in liver function tests ( LFTs) has been found in patients with COVID-19 ranging 14%-75% Some studies found higher levels of transaminases in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and in patients dying for COVID-19.\n\nThe clinical relevance of LFTs abnormalities has been controversial, with some studies suggesting its association with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas others not.Some limitations affected those studies involving the lack of information about concomitant or previous use of hepatotoxic drugs among the others.\n\nInitial reports indicate a high incidence of abnormal liver tests and acute kidney injury (AKI) in the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels at admission and their associations with AKI are not well understood.\n\nAim of the work\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of liver injury at admission and its contribution to the development of AKI, severity of COVID-19 and outcomes in Sohag University hospital\n\nPatients and methods\n\nType of the Study:\n\nA prospective, observational cohort study will be conducted between December 2021 and May 2022 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Sohag University Hospital.\n\nPatients:\n\nInclusion criteria :\n\nPatients who are positive for COVID-19 infection in Sohag University Hospital whose ages < 18 years old. (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples) who developed AKI at time of admission or during admission.\n\nExclusion criteria :\n\nPatients whose ages >18 years old.\n\nMethods A prospective, observational cohort study will be conducted between December 2021 and April 2022 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Sohag University Hospital.\n\nThe routine laboratory parameters will be measured before the beginning of this Study After conducting a complete physical examination.\n\ndemographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data will be collected at admission. Information on medical history, including comorbidities, symptoms of infection and drugs taken in the previous 14 days before admission will be collected. Vital signs (respiratory rate [RR], body temperature [BT], arterial blood pressure, heart rate [HR], pulse oxygen saturation [SatO2] were collected. Laboratory tests including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum Albumin, Total protein, serum creatinine, Blood urea nitrogen, serum electrolytes and bilirubin were collected at admission and every 7 ± 2 days during the admission.\n\nPatients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be divided into three groups as mild, moderate, and severe disease to evaluate the relationship between disease severity and AKI. Patients with clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnoea, fast breathing) plus one of the following: respiratory rate >30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress;or SpO2 < 90% on room air will be considered as severe cases.\n\nPatients with pneumonia and have no above severity criteria will be considered as moderate cases. Symptomatic patients without evidence of viral pneumonia or hypoxia will be considered as mild cases.\n\nStatistical analysis :\n\nAll data will be collected and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science ( SPSS to investigate the incidence of liver injury at admission and its contribution to the development of AKI, severity of COVID-19 and outcomes in Sohag University hospital\n\nEthical Consideration :\n\nThe study will be assessed by scientific and ethical committee of Sohag faculty of medicine, an informed written consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the study."

              "BriefSummary":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China. It rapidly spread, resulting a global pandemic in March 2020. Globally, till 27 August 2021, there have been 214,468,601 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 4,470,969 deaths, reported to WHO.\n\nWith the absence of curative treatment for COVID-19 infection the development of safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty vaccine was listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 31 December 2020. The SII/Covishield and AstraZeneca/AZD1222 vaccines (developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford and manufactured by the State Institute of India and SK Bio respectively) were given EUL on 16 February. The Janssen/Ad26.COV 2.S developed by Johnson & Johnson, was listed for EUL on 12 March 2021. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA 1273) was listed for EUL on 30 April 2021 and the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was listed for EUL on 7 May 2021. The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG). The Sinovac-CoronaVac was listed for EUL on 1 June 2021. As of 25 August 2021, a total of 4,953,887,422 vaccine doses have been administered. In large, randomized-controlled trials, vaccines were found to be safe and efficacious in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\n\nHowever, a small percentage of fully vaccinated persons will develop symptomatic or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A vaccine breakthrough infection is defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a respiratory specimen collected from a person ≥14 days after receipt of all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported from 46 U.S. states and territories as of April 30, 2021. Among these cases, 6,446 (63%) occurred in females, and the median patient age was 58 years (interquartile range = 40-74 years). Based on preliminary data, 2,725 (27%) vaccine breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, 995 (10%) patients were known to be hospitalized, and 160 (2%) patients died."

In India there were 3,95,048 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a mortality rate of 3.3%. In Tamil Nadu there were 54,449 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a mortality rate of 1.2% according to the report of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India on June 19, 2020.\n\nCOVID-19 infection is a double challenge for people with diabetes. India has a large number of persons with diabetes (more than 77 million). Recent studies have reported rising prevalence both in the urban and rural populations. The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) also shows an increasing trend in the last few decades. Mortality seems to be threefold higher in people with diabetes when COVD-19 coexists when compared with mortality due to COVID-19 without comorbidities.\n\nYang et al noted that among 52 intensive care patients who had COVID 19 infection, 22% had diabetes among the non-survivors. In a study of 173 patients with severe disease, 16.2% had diabetes, and in another study of 140 hospitalized patients, 12% had diabetes. Li et al compared intensive care and non-intensive care patients who had COVID-19. They showed a twofold increase in the incidence of diabetes in intensive care patients.\n\nIn addition to diabetes; the other common co-morbidities present in COVID 19 patients were hypertension (20%), cardiovascular disease (16%), and lung disease (6%). In this context, patients with diabetes have been listed as people with higher severity for COVID-19 by several health authorities. However, precise data regarding patients with and without diabetes having COVID-19 infection are still lacking. Moreover, the relationship between diabetes and the severity of COVID-19 remains unknown. In this study, we intend to identify the disease severity and mortality in people with and without diabetes admitted for COVID-19 in southern India.",

Respiratory disease is the main form of disease causing acute respiratory distress as the main cause of death.\n\nIncreased number of cases worldwide had put an enormous load on public health resulting lockdowns, quarantines and curfews. Predicting number of cases is hard as the increment of cases between communities differ.\n\nTime series had been used in different fields of science to predict, such as signal processing, mathematical finance, weather prediction. In medicine, time series analysis were used in number of admitted patients to hospitals. Aim of this study is to predict the total number of Covid-19 cases worldwide using time series anaylsis."

The vaccine will be offered to adults (18 years old and above) according to the location of their homes in a cluster. The vaccine schedule is two doses with four-weeks interval. Baseline samples to determine previous immunity will be collected before vaccination.\n\nCases of COVID-19 reported in the city will be recorded according to the WHO clinical progression scale. Comparison of periods before and after vaccination and relation to immunization coverage will be considered for the assessment of effectiveness in the clusters and groups of clusters."

Following provision of informed consent, patients will be randomized into three groups: High-titre convalescent plasma, low-titre convalescent plasma or placebo. Primary outcomes of the study will cover safety and either intubation or initiation of systemic corticosteroids. Safety information collected will include serious adverse events judged to be related to administration of convalescent plasma. Microbiological and other laboratory parameters will be followed up.",
              "DetailedDescription":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a serious global public health threat urgently requiring both prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells involves a binding between its spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells. Convalescent sera of Covid-19 patients have been shown to contain SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. Accordingly, recovered patients are presumed to be immune to re-infection. Use of convalescent plasma as treatment warrants research, which is supported by the European Commission. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a classical adaptive immunotherapy. It has been applied to prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases: evidence of success has been accumulated e.g. on treatment of SARS, MERS, and 2009 H1N1, for which satisfactory efficacy and safety have been shown.\n\nThe investigators will select as donors for CP therapy patients recovered from Covid-19 with a high neutralizing antibody titre who meet normal blood donor eligibility criteria. The donors will be recruited among participants of ongoing Covid-19 immunity studies (Clin-Covid, Commun-Covid) and/or from Finnish Red Cross Blood Service (FRCBS) blood donors.\n\nCP will be prepared from the blood of eligible donors at the FRCBS according to previous protocols and the European guidelines for fresh frozen plasma. After the screening test results required for product release (HCV, HBV, HIV, ABO, Syphilis) are available, the units will be released. All donors will be screened for type-I-Interferon antibodies and women will be screened for HLA-antibodies. The units will be labelled with convalescence plasma labels including ICCBBA/ISBT compliant product codes. The plasma units will be frozen to -25°C within 6 hours from collection. Prior to freezing 3 ml of CP will be separated and divided in 3 aliquots to be stored, for possible later analysis.\n\nPatients admitted to ward at HUH will be randomized 1:1:1 into three groups which will be given 1) high-titre convalescent plasma (HCP), 2) low-titre convalescent plasma (LCP) or 3) placebo. The plasma preparations and placebo will be given as one 200 mL infusion. ABORh blood group will be determined from patients prior to transfusion according to normal transfusion protocols of the hospital. The study will be double-blinded with saline as placebo given to groups three. The primary outcomes of the study will cover safety and intubation/initiation of systemic corticosteroids. AEs will be reviewed, recorded and reported up to 6 hours after administration of CP or placebo. Thromboembolic and cardiovascular events will be recorded as AEs or SAEs up to 7 days after administration of CP / placebo. SAEs will be reviewed, recorded and reported up to 7 days after administration of CP / placebo. In case of respiratory failures classified as SAEs, the reporting period is only up to 12 hours after administration of CP / placebo."

One to three sites in the Canada will participate over an approximate 6-week enrolment period. The actual enrolment period will be dependent upon prevalence of Covid-19, and site set up. Once positives sample size is achieved, expected SARC-CoV-2 negative subjects will be permitted.\n\nOnce subjects are consented and recruited for the study, up to three (3) study-specific nasopharyngeal samples for each patient will be collected by trained operators at the clinical site: a single SOC swab, and two (2) Spartan swabs where the second swab is optional and used when the first Spartan swab test does not produce a positive or negative result (\"inconclusive\").\n\nThe first swab sample will be tested at the clinical site according to standard of care protocols currently in place for the sites' nasopharyngeal swab-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. The second nasopharyngeal sample will be tested at the site using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System. A third, optional nasopharyngeal sample, if collected, will be tested using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System only when the test conducted with the second nasopharyngeal swab does not produce a positive or negative result."

              "DetailedDescription":"BACKGROUND:\n\nIn February, the first case of SARS-CoV2 positive patient was recorded in Lombardy (Italy), a virus capable of causing a severe form of acute respiratory failure called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nQualitative assessments of lung morphology have been identified to describe macroscopic characteristics of this infection upon admission and during the hospitalization of patients.\n\nAt the moment, there are no studies that have exhaustively described the parenchymal lung damage induced by SARS-CoV2 by quantitative analysis.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that specific morphological and quantitative alterations of the lung parenchyma assessed by means of CT scan in patients suffering from severe respiratory insufficiency induced by SARS-CoV2 may have an impact on the severity of the degree of alteration of the respiratory exchanges (oxygenation and clearance of the CO2) and have an impact on patient outcome.\n\nThe presence of characteristic lung morphological patterns assessed by CT scan could allow the recognition of specific patient clusters who can benefit from intensive treatment differently, making a significant contribution to stratifying the severity of patients and their risk of mortality.\n\nThis is an exploratory clinical descriptive study of lung CT images in a completely new patient population who are nucleic acid amplification test confirmed SARS-CoV2 positive.\n\nSAMPLE SIZE (n. patients):\n\nThe study will collect all patients with the inclusion criteria; a total of 500 patients are expected to be collected.\n\nAbout 80 patients will be enrolled for each local experimental center.\n\nThe following patient data will be analyzed:\n\nblood gas analytical data assigned to the CT scan, checks performed upon entering the hospital, at the time of performing the CT scan, admission to intensive care and 7 days after entry\npatient characteristics such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI)\ncomorbidity\npresence of organ dysfunction with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)\nlaboratory data relating to hospital admission and symptoms prior to hospitalization.\nventilator and hemodynamic parameters upon entering the hospital, at the time of carrying out the CT scan, upon admission to intensive care and 7 days after entry.\n\nThe machine learning approach of lung CT scan analysis will aim at evaluating:\n\nQuantitative and qualitative lung alterations;\nThe stratification of such morphological characteristics in specific morphological lung clusters identified by the means of artificial intelligence using deep learning algorithms.\n\nETHICAL ASPECTS:\n\nThe lung CT scan images will be collected and anonymized. Images will be subsequently sent by University of Milano-Bicocca Institutional google drive account to the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care and the Department of Radiology in a deidentified format for advanced quantitative analysis taking advantage of artificial intelligence using deep learning algorithms.\n\nThe data will be collected in a pseudo-anonymous way through paper Case Report Form (CRF) and analyzed by the scientific coordinator of the project.\n\nGiven the retrospective nature of the study and in the presence of technical difficult in obtaining an informed consent of patients in this period of pandemic emergency, informed consent will be waived.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nContinuous data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median and interquartile range, according to data distribution that will be evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables will be expressed as proportions (frequency).\n\nThe deep learning segmentation algorithm will segment the lung parenchyma from the entire CT lung. Lung volume, lung weight and opacity intensity distribution analysis will be applied. Second, clustering analysis to stratify the patients will be performed. Both an intensity and a spatial clustering algorithm will be tested. Third, a model will be trained to predict the injury progression using the images and all other patient data. Statistical significance will be considered in the presence of a p<0.05 (two-tailed)."

Several risk factors for critical illness and death from the disease have been proposed. However, the observed associations between different comorbidities and chronic medications have not fully been related to the frequencies of the same comorbidities and chronic medications in age- and sex-matched controls from the general population. This is important since some of the proposed risk factors are very common in the aged who, by age alone, are more prone to a more severe course of the disease.\n\nBy combining several registries, we will compare, on several comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes and several medications such as immunosuppressant drugs and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, the first 2000 cases of COVID-19 patients receiving critical care in Sweden to a set 8000 age- and sex-matched controls.",

The survey is voluntary and written informed consent is obtained . EMS personnel can still get the free testing even if they do not want to fill out the survey.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 antigen and IgM and IgG markers amongst our county/EMS workers.\n\nThe secondary objective is to describe whether the antigen/antibody markers are significantly correlated to the presence of a set of symptoms in the prior 3 weeks, and/or to the baseline demographics such as age, sex, and presence of co-morbidities."

              "BriefSummary":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first appeared in China, and then spread around the world. In December 2019, a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin were infected after exposure to the market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Very quickly, a new coronavirus was isolated from a sample of a patient's lower respiratory tract and the entire virus genome was sequenced. This new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 for its genetic homology with SARS-CoV, has shown worldwide spread. Thus, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 epidemic as a threat to public health at the international level, then, in March 2020, the global situation degenerated into a pandemic. Johns Hopkins University has reported more than 7,600,000 cases of infections and more than 427,000 deaths as of June 13, 20203. Due to the rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited capacity of molecular laboratory tests, the concept of delocalized molecular tests appears to be relevant. Indeed, the urgent need to increase testing for COVID-19 has been clearly identified as an essential part of the strategy to combat the coronavirus worldwide. In fact, COVID-19 represents a major public health problem currently causing a rapidly increasing number of infections and significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-211. As of August 25, 2020, this tally is 23,741,562 cases of contamination and 813,820 deaths following Johns Hopkins University.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Early detection with a sensitive technique of COVID-19 is essential to ensure rapid and appropriate patient management, to contain the epidemic and to better understand the global epidemiology of the virus. This detection will intensify in the coming months due to the start of the school year and university as well as the economic recovery.\n\nUntil now, laboratory diagnostics have relied primarily on the amplification and detection of viral gene sequences in upper respiratory tract samples performed in a centralized laboratory. A new test (ID NowTM COVID-19 developed by the Abbott laboratory) is available on the market. This test is the first in France to be able to be carried out in a medical examination of delocalized biology (MEDB) and makes it possible to return a result in 15 min directly in the clinical department. This speed will allow faster care, isolation and filiarisation of COVID-19 patients. The speed of this technique is based on the use of isothermal gene amplification. The investigators will be the first to evaluate it in France in MEDB in the context of urgent care. This evaluation of diagnostic performance will be performed during a comparison with that of our routine PCR microbiology laboratory test Simplexa ™ COVID-19 Direct assay marketed by the company DiaSorin.\n\nThis speed of obtaining results should lead to better efficiency of medical management, faster isolation and organization for COVID-19 positive patients.\n\nThe objective of this work is to assess diagnostic performance in relocated biology in a real situation and to validate this rapid strategy for the benefit of patients consulting the emergency department."

              "BriefSummary":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a pandemic, which has affected approximately 4 lakhs individuals and claimed 16,362 deaths till now. SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with myocarditis and renal dysfunction. Patients hospitalized for Covid-19 severe infection are more prone to excessive coagulation activation leading to thrombotic events both in the venous and arterial circulations, due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. Nearly 20% of COVID-19 patients present severe coagulation abnormalities, which may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases. Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders. The importance of high D-dimer and Fibrin degradation product level to determine the patient prognostic and the risk of thrombosis is known. In a French study, it was found that a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms. Preliminary reports on COVID-19 patients' clinical and laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure present a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy.\n\nAnother study highlights this common finding in most COVID-19 patients with high D-dimer levels which are associated with a worse prognosis. Cases showed significantly higher fibrinogen and D-dimer plasma levels versus healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Markedly hypercoagulable thromboelastometry profiles were observed in COVID-19 patients, as reflected by shorter Clot Formation Time (CFT) in INTEM (p = 0.0002) and EXTEM (p = 0.01) and higher Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF). Fibrin formation and polymerization may predispose to thrombosis and correlate with a worse outcome.\n\nGlobal VE tests provide a more physiologic assessment of coagulation and should be considered to guide blood transfusion requirements in liver transplantation and other major surgery. Its application in patients with Covid19 or in a critical care setting requires more data. Viscoelastic tests, which include TEG, ROTEM, and Sonoclot, offer a means of assessing the activity of pro-and anticoagulant pathways, hyperfibrinolysis, and excessive clot lysis. Assessment of clot formation can be performed in 10 to 20 minutes as a point of care (POC) test; however, assessment of clot lysis takes 30 to 60 minutes. SIRS and sepsis trigger the release of endogenous heparinoids, or a heparin-like effect (HLE), due to small endothelium/mast cell-derived glycosaminoglycan's, which can be detected on heparinase-treated viscoelastic assays.\n\nViscoelastic testing of global coagulation such as thromboelastometry and Sonoclot has been proposed as a superior tool to rapidly diagnose and help guide resuscitation with blood products and anticoagulation. it is deemed necessary to determine the influence of Covid 19 on coagulation parameters using point of care coagulation using sonoclot and conventional coagulation tests. In this prospective trial, the investigators aim to evaluate coagulation abnormalities via traditional tests and whole blood Sonclot profiles in a group of 50 consecutive patients with critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Covid ICU OF Nehru Hospital extension, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Several Consensus statements have been published in the literature in the last 2 months emphasizing the need for data in Covid 19 to assess the risk of both bleeding i.e. disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thromboses (stoke, myocardial infarction, dialysis catheter blocks).\n\nEarly reports showed that very high D-dimer levels are common in COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate with a worse prognosis. To better characterize COVID-19-related coagulation changes, many studies are showing some initial data regarding the role of procoagulant micro thrombotic changes rather than DIC. Coagulation profiles observed in studies published in the last one month reflect a severe hypercoagulability rather than a consumptive coagulopathy (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation). Such a laboratory pattern and association can be linked to both markedly increased levels of fibrinogen and an excessive fibrin polymerization due to the infection. SARS-CoV-2 is likely to promote massive fibrin formation and deposition which can also account for the extremely high D-dimer levels found in these patients. Fibrin deposition in alveolar and interstitial lung spaces, in addition to microcirculation thrombosis, may contribute to worsening respiratory failure resulting in prolonged mechanical ventilation, poor prognosis, and death. Furthermore, other major venous thromboembolic events and arterial complications (e.g., acute myocardial infarction) have been reported and are likely to be largely underestimated. In this regard, anticoagulant therapy may improve the prognosis in COVID19 patients as reported by various studies. In light of the severe hypercoagulable state observed in these patients, effective anticoagulant prophylaxis should be considered to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications. This will be the first prospective study to assess the impact of adequate dosages of anticoagulants on clotting parameters in an Indian scenario.\n\nThere are several ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the prevention and management of the thrombotic and thromboembolic disease.\n\nFirst, the direct effects of COVID-19 or the indirect effects of infection, such as through severe illness and hypoxia, may predispose patients to thrombotic events. Preliminary reports suggest that hemostatic abnormalities, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), occur in patients affected by COVID-19.\nAdditionally, the severe inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying traditional risk factors may all predispose to thrombotic events, similar to prior virulent zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.\nInvestigational therapies for treating COVID-19 may have adverse drug-drug interactions with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants.\nLastly the pandemic, because of resource allocations or social distancing recommendations, may adversely affect the care of patients without COVID-19 but who present with thrombotic events. For example, (mis)perception that antithrombotic agents confer increased risk for contracting COVID-19, may lead to untoward interruption of anticoagulation by some patients\n\nFurther, a few of these investigational agents being used for Covid19 have been associated with excess risk (or, in other cases, reduced risk) for thrombotic events, or for thrombocytopenia in prior studies of non-COVID-19 populations. For example, bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and is under investigational use for COVID-19, is associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including MI, cerebrovascular accidents, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Alternatively, fingolimod, an immunomodulating agent being tried for COVID-19, may reduce reperfusion injury and improve outcomes in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke. Hydroxychorloquine, recently receiving Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of COVID-19, may potentially exert antithrombotic properties, especially against anti-phospholipid antibodies.\n\nThere is no data available on the subject of India. However preliminary data from our institute suggest the following which is in concordance with published data elsewhere\n\nThe most consistent hemostatic abnormalities with COVID-19 include mild thrombocytopenia and increased D-dimer levels, which are associated with a higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, or death.\nDisease severity is variably associated with prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) and variably by a trend toward shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).\n\nHospitalized patients with COVID-19 who have respiratory failure or co-morbidities (e.g., active cancer, or heart failure), patients who are bedridden, and those requiring intensive care should receive pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, unless there are contraindications. The choice of agents and dosing should be based on available guideline recommendations. The World Health Organization interim guidance statement recommends prophylactic daily low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), or twice daily subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH). If pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated, mechanical VTE prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression) should be considered in immobilized patients. In this regard, the once-daily dosing regimen of LMWHs may be advantageous over UFH to reduce personal protective equipment (PPE) use and exposure of healthcare workers.\n\nPOC test services as quality assured pathology services using analytical devices (including test kits and analysers), provided near to the patient rather than in the traditional environment of a clinical laboratory.\n\nThese POC tests can be classified as Viscoelastic POC (vPOC) tests which include Thromboelastography (TEG), rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and Sonoclot; and Platelet function tests which are Platelet function analyser, etc. TEG, ROTEM, and Sonoclot analysis are point-of-care coagulation monitoring devices which assess the viscoelastic properties of whole blood. They measure the entire clotting process, at the bedside and in a sample of whole blood. Coagulation factors present in plasma interact with platelets and red cells displaying results in a pictorial manner starting with fibrin formation and continue through clot retraction and fibrinolysis.\n\nThe role of SCTS for coagulation correction in patients with Covid19 is unclear and using POC tests in ICUs will be of great help in tailoring treatment\n\nInvestigators will also try to determine the influence of sepsis on coagulation disorders in COVID - 19 patients, to correctly identify the type and optimal quantity of blood product requirement in at-risk patients."

The epidemic, which was described as not very severe during the year 2020 in Reunion was much more intense and more deadly in 2021, with the arrival of the new variants (South African and Indian) and exploded at the beginning of the year 2022 (variant Omicron).\n\nReunion has a specific island context both climato-geographically and demographically. Indeed, this French island located in the southern hemisphere in the middle of the Indian Ocean (OI) has a tropical climate and a multi-ethnic population, younger than in mainland France (16% are over 60 years old). It is also marked by a higher prevalence in the general population of certain risk factors, such as obesity (11%) and type 2 diabetes (>10%), recognized as factors favoring severe clinical forms of COVID-19. as well as \"persistent COVID-19\".\n\nThis study will allow the constitution of a large-scale French cohort located in a closed overseas territory to provide answers to local specificities and to the management of the epidemic in the territory."

The study will retrospectively analyze data already collected at the post COVID-19 outpatients services of the participating centers; furthermore, a prospective cohort study will be performed.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Background:\n\nThe EuCARE project includes several cohorts of patients and schools to provide an advance response to COVID-19 epidemics. The cohorts belong to different geographic areas including European countries, Kenya, Mexico, Russia and Vietnam, and will consolidate or expand interactions with other cohorts. A comprehensive multidisciplinary team of clinicians, virologists, epidemiologists, statisticians and top experts in artificial intelligence will collaborate to investigate:\n\nthe natural and artificial immunity to the different viral variants in health care workers;\nthe clinical course and long-term follow up of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to derive the role of different viral variants in the outcome of the infection, including post COVID-19 condition;\nthe best strategies to control the spread of different viral variants in schools, by comparing the outcome of diverse containment and prevention measures in relation to the prevalence and dynamics of the variants.\n\nPost COVID-19 condition is defined as the persistence or new onset of symptoms 3 months after an acute episode of COVID-19; these symptoms could last 2 or even more months and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. The prevalence of these ongoing symptoms is very variable among the different studies, but seems high, affecting up to 50-60% of recovered patients.\n\nMoreover, the post COVID-19 condition is described more commonly in females and more severe patients, but can be observed at all ages and in patients with a mild acute episode of COVID-19 disease.\n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES The hypothesis of the study is that a relatively high proportion of patients recovered from an acute COVID-19 episode develops long-term sequelae, defined as the presence of ongoing or new onset physical and/or psychological symptoms at three months after the acute illness. These symptoms could last at least two months or even longer.\n\nThe mechanisms underpinning the post-acute and chronic manifestations of COVID-19 are not entirely understood.\n\nThe predictors of post COVID-19 condition have not yet identified, but the first evidence suggest that patients experiencing persistent symptoms, at 4-weeks or 8-weeks after the acute disease, were more likely elderly, females and hospitalized in the acute phase compared to the patients reporting symptoms for a short period of time (Carole et al, 2021).\n\nWe also hypothesized that older age, female gender, severity of disease and previous patients' comorbidities could be risk factors for the development of post COVID-19 condition.\n\nFinally, our hypothesis is that the new variant \"Omicron\" could be associated with a lower inflammation and disease's severity during the acute phase and, thus, with a lower incidence of post COVID-19 condition.\n\nStudy objective:\n\nPrimary objective is to assess the incidence and risk factors of post COVID-19 condition in a cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\nto evaluate the association between circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and risk of post COVID-19 condition; to evaluate long-term residual organ damage (lung, hearth, Central Nervous System, CNS, Peripheral Nervous System, PNS) in relation to patient's characteristics and virology (variant, viral load in the acute phase)."

              "BriefSummary":"Coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory disease that causes respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction in patients.\n\nWith the increased understanding of the severity of COVID-19 and clinical evidence in accordance with the opinions of first-line clinical experts involved in the treatment of this epidemic, the investigators believe that the participation of patients with sequelae of COVID-19 in a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program would be of utmost importance.\n\nAccording to recent scientific recommendations for patients with sequelae of COVID-19, respiratory rehabilitation would alleviate symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety and depression and, eventually, improve physical functions and quality of life.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to anticipate early rehabilitation after the acute phase of ARDS, in order to limit the severity of the effects of the ICU and promote rapid functional recovery. Physiotherapy will play a role in providing exercise, mobilization and rehabilitation interventions for survivors of critical illnesses associated with COVID-19, in order to enable a functional social return.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The investigatores propose a clinical, prospective and consecutive study composed of participants with pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 and pulmonary diseases such as COPD, Asthma, Bronchitis, Emphysema, Bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis. Initially, all patients will undergo a physical assessment, pulmonary function tests and nutritional assessment, in addition to applying the modified dyspnea scale of the MMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), according to the standards recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).\n\nThe proposed Outpatient and Home Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program is based on the Guidelines recommended by the Brazilian Society of Pulmonology (SBPT) and by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), with a minimum duration of 12 weeks, frequency of 3 weekly sessions, accompanied by health professionals in this field.\n\nPatients who seek care at municipal and state health services in the city of Anápolis, (Goiás) will be recruited. Patients with clinically stabilized COVID - 19 sequelae will be considered eligible, and who agree to participate in the study, signing the Informed Consent .\n\nThe outpatient PRP consisted of a combination of aerobic and strengthening exercises, lasting 12 weeks, frequency 3 times a week. Each session will consist of active warm-up exercises, upper and lower limb strengthening, aerobic conditioning and stretching exercises. The warm-up phase consists of intercalated calisthenic exercises for different muscle groups, according to each patient's tolerance."

Supportive data exist for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID19 and other overwhelming viral illnesses. The study team wants to test the hypothesis that treatment with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary effects on COVID19 disease severity/duration, with the primary objective to reduce mortality. In addition, a major secondary objective to reduce the requirement for and/or duration of mechanical ventilation. The first phase is to test the safety of CP therapy.",

The disease caused by SARS CoV-2 (COVID19) is manifest by fever, fatigue, dry cough, pharyngitis, and headache. In addition to the common clinical presentation of respiratory distress, and increasing frequency of cardiovascular manifestations has become evident.\n\nIn this context, the investigators propose to evaluate the safety of intravenous administration of convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring hospitalization for symptomatic \"high risk\" COVID19 disease. The study team wants to test the hypothesis that treatment with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary effects on COVID19 disease severity/duration, with the primary objective to reduce mortality. In addition, a major secondary objective to reduce the requirement for and/or duration of mechanical ventilation This is a single-arm, non-randomized, open-label treatment of eligible subjects defined as those who satisfy all inclusion criteria.\n\nWritten informed consent will be obtained all eligible subjects prior to participation.\n\nConvalescent plasma will be obtained from male donors, nulliparous females, or female donors negative for HLA antibodies at least 14 days following recovery from COVID-19 infection."

              "DetailedDescription":"Corona-virus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and this virus was first originated from Wuhan city of Hubei province of China spreading around the globe. The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea, and other symptoms noted in patients affected by COVID-19 that includes; chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell. In addition, the emergency warning signs of COVID-19 include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse and bluish lips or face and the patients experiencing any of these signs should get immediate medical attention.\n\nHerbal medicines are used by many people to try to improve their health upon the believe that \"natural products\" are always safe, and good for immunity based on the traditional knowledge .There is a potential of Nigella Sativa to treat the patients with COVID-19.\n\nNigella Sativa (NS), a widely used medicinal plant of the family Ranunculaceae ; commonly known as Black Cumin, has been shown to exert antiviral effects against a variety of viruses such as Mouse Cytomegalovirus and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) . The components' antimicrobial properties against various microbes as well as their anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory effects have also been established .\n\nThe immune system defends the body from foreign, invading organisms, promoting protective immunity, while maintaining tolerance to self. The implications of vitamin deficiency on the immune system have become clearer in recent years, and in the context of vitamin D deficiency, the increased susceptibility to infection observed, especially in a genetically susceptible host to autoimmunity.\n\nThe classical actions of vitamin D are to promote calcium homeostasis, and to promote bone health. In humans, vitamin D is obtained from the diet, or synthesized in the skin as vitamin D is cutaneously produced after exposure to UV light, its synthesis is influenced by latitude, season, use of sun-block and skin pigmentation. Melanin absorbs UV radiation inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin D from 7-dihydrocholesterol. This initial vitamin D compound is inactive form; hydroxylation in the liver to form the active 25 hydroxy vitamin D3 (25 D). Vitamin D is the most reliable measurement of an individual's vitamin D status. It is converted in the kidney to the active compound 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25 D) or calcidiol by 1-α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), an enzyme which is stimulated by parathormone.\n\nA principal defense against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients, and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines, and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia, and viral upper respiratory tract infections."

              "DetailedDescription":"This cross-sectional study was conducted between October, 16 to 23, 2020 by sending an online survey questionnaire working in public and university hospitals, including general dentists or specialists. The tool utilized for data collection was a designed online Google Forms questionnaire.\n\nThis survey was implemented by using a questionnaire that included socio-demographic data (age range, gender, marital status, systemic disease, professional area, years of clinical experience, number of patients treated daily, smoking status, alcohol consumption, vs), epidemic-related questions and scales measuring the fear and anxiety levels of the participants.\n\nFear of COVID-19 Scale is an unidimensional scale seven-item scale assessing anxiety regarding COVID-19 developed by Ahorsu et al. Items are rated on a 5-item Likert scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) with scores ranging from 7 to 35. A higher score of the FCV-19S represents a greater level of fear. In the study, the bi-factor model and two-factor model consisting of the \"emotional response\" factor (items 1, 2, 4, and 5) and \"physiological response\" factor (items 3, 6, and 7) were used.\n\nCoronavirus Anxiety Scale is an unidimensional tool that assesses the physiological reactions anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked to rate 5 items on a 5-point Likert-type scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day over the last 2 weeks)."

Thirty naive and 30 COVID positive participants will have a blood sample taken after informed consent and be assessed for COVID symptoms according to WHO classification. Participants will be followed monthly for 6 months. At each contact, participants will be assessed for COVID symptoms and progress since the previous visit.",
              "DetailedDescription":"This is an observational study of participants who are being or have been tested for COVID-19. Participants with or without COVID-19 will be entered into one of two groups for Stage 1 and one of three groups for Stage 2.\n\nStage 1:\n\nGroup 1: Participants whose COVID-19 test is negative and who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 disease.\nGroup 2: Participants whose COVID-19 test is positive and who have Severe or Critical symptoms of COVID-19 disease.\n\nStage 2:\n\nGroup 1: Participants whose COVID-19 test is negative and who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 disease.\nGroup 2: Participants whose COVID-19 test is positive and who have Mild or Moderate symptoms of COVID-19 disease.\nGroup 3: Participants whose COVID-19 test is positive and who have Severe or Critical symptoms of COVID-19 disease.\n\nDuring Stage 1, Group 1 participants will be matched to Group 2 subjects as follows: Age: 18-64 and >65; Race: Caucasian, Latino, African American, other; Sex: Male or Female Each participant will be assigned a study number. The study case report form (CRF) will record the participants initials, age and study number. Participants will have blood drawn for biomarkers. All samples will be identified using the participants age and study number. Blood volume will be approximately ten milliliters to yield at least four 1 ml serum aliquots. Serum will be frozen at -80ºF and stored. Batch shipments of the serum will occur during the study and sent to AccessDx Laboratory in Houston TX. Laboratory procedures for AccessDx are presented in Appendices B and C. AccessDx will perform the following biomarker tests on the serum: Interleukins 1B, 6, 8,10, 22; CRP; Ferritin; Interferon-ꝩ; MIP 1α and 1β; TNF; VEGF A, B, C.\n\nParticipants will be followed for up to 6 months and have monthly calls from the study staff. As much as possible, the participant will be contacted by the same study member at each follow-up visit. If agreed with the participant, information about the participants status may be collected on email or text. Participants will be asked specific questions and their responses recorded on a paper CRF. At enrollment and at each follow-up call, the participant's severity of COVID-19 disease will be categorized based on WHO Interim guidance 27 May 2020 as follows:\n\nMild cases are marked by the onset of symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, diarrhea, and so forth, without evidence of viral pneumonia or hypoxia.\nModerate cases include clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea, fast breathing) but no signs of severe pneumonia, including SpO2 ≥ 90% on room air.\nSevere cases demonstrate clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea, fast breathing) plus one of the following: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress; or SpO2 < 90% on room air.\nCritical cases present symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and/or septic shock A participant's engagement in the study will be approximately 6 months. Recruitment is expected to last 6 months. It is expected that the total study for Stage 1 will be one year. The duration of Stage 2 will not be determined until results from Stage 1 are available. The number of investigator sites for Stage 1 is expected to be up to 3 and for Stage 2, up to 50."

At day 0, participants who meet the eligibility requirements will undergo a thorough medical evaluation and a urine pregnancy test (if applicable). Eligible participants will be placed in one of three vaccination interval groups (4, 8 or 12 weeks between the first two Covid -19 (recombinante) vaccine doses) in a randomized manner, via a computer program created by the statistical annalist. Both participant and research team will know the allocated group.\n\nEligible and consenting participants will have a blood sample collected (IgG Anti-S antibodies) and immediately after be administered a third dose of the Covid-19 (recombinante) vaccine. Participants will be instructed to fill out an adverse events journal for solicited adverse events for 7 days and non-solicited adverse events for 28 days after each dose. The research team will contact the participant remotely at least twice during the first two weeks.\n\nThe participant will return for a follow-up visit to the research center 28 days after each dose, to evaluate adverse events, collect blood samples (IgG Anti-S antibodies) and undergo a thorough medical evaluation.\n\nThe participant will also return to the research center to collect blood samples (IgG Anti-S antibodies) in two more follow-up visits: 6 and 12 months after vaccination with Covid-19 (recombinante)."

              "BriefSummary":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant loss of life and suffering with total case and death counts increasing daily, particularly with the emergence of the delta variant. COVID-19 vaccines have proven highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Nevertheless, according to VA data sources, only 56% of all U.S. Veterans have been vaccinated to date, largely owing to vaccine hesitancy and lack of access to vaccination. Thus, there is a critical need for evidence-based interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and access among Veterans, many of whom are vulnerable to poor outcomes of COVID-19. The overall goal of this study is to increase COVID-19 vaccination in Veterans of VISNs 16 and 21 who remain unvaccinated either because of vaccine hesitancy or lack of access to COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically, the investigators will test a COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Intervention (Motivational Interviewing) plus Implementation Facilitation.",
              "DetailedDescription":"For Aim 1, the investigators will conduct a one-year cluster randomized controlled trial of a Vaccine Acceptance Intervention versus Usual Care with randomization at the level of VA Medical Center (VAMC). Usual Care will consist of all national and local initiatives to promote COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Veterans such as vaccine mandates, mobile clinics, outreach calls, etc. The Implementation Facilitation team will include a VISN-level external facilitator, VAMC-level internal facilitators, and clinic-level site champions to support PACT staff, Coaches and Peers in implementing the Vaccine Acceptance Intervention with unvaccinated Veterans as well as in lowering barriers to vaccine access at intervention sites. For Aim 2, the investigators will identify a diverse sample of 450 Veterans across VAMCs in VISNs 16 and 21, who have had primary care visits at Intervention and Usual Care sites, and who have either recently received (N=360) or have not received (N=90) COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators will over sample recently vaccinated Veterans to describe the impact of the Vaccine Acceptance Intervention on Veterans' decisions to accept COVID-19 vaccination in addition to over-sampling women, ethnic/racial minorities, rural and younger Veterans, and those with mental health conditions. Follow-up qualitative interviews will be conducted in a subsample to better understand factors related to recent vaccine acceptance and persistent vaccine hesitancy. Finally, for Aim 3, the investigators will conduct process and summative interviews with VA staff and providers from VAMC sites in VISNs 16 and 21 with high and low vaccination rates) to learn which implementation strategies were most and least effective."

All subjects will be received 2 doses of Omicron COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated according to the immunization schedule of 0, 21-28 days. The change in neutralizing antibody level at 28 days after the second dose was used to determine whether to receive a further booster dose for ≥3 months.\n\nThe occurrence of adverse events within 28 days and serious adverse events within 6 months after vaccination will be observed. In addition, blood samples will be collected on Day 0 before vaccination,Day 14 after dose 1, before dose 2 and on day 14, 28 and month 3, 6, 9, 12 after dose 2. Serum antibody levels, cellular immune responses will be analyzed."

The objective of this observational study is to follow up the clinical outcomes after vaccination in all the headquarters of the National University of Colombia. It is a project that is considered institutional importance and is part of the actions that the National University of Colombia has proposed to the national government to accompany the national vaccination program.\n\nThe proposed follow-up includes the sociodemographic, cultural, clinical and pharmacological characterization of the vaccinated population, including the report of adverse events occurring after the vaccination process, the behavior of the population after the administration of the vaccine, monitoring serological outcomes, identification of medication errors and therapeutic failure. Three stages are proposed in which the population affiliated to UNISALUD is gradually included, then the beneficiaries and later the student community and their families.\n\nThe scope of the attached protocol includes Stage I, which corresponds to teachers and administrative staff (active and retired) linked to UNISALUD.",
              "DetailedDescription":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes and adverse events associated with immunization (ESAVI) of vaccines against COVID-19 in the cohort of the university community, affiliates and beneficiaries of UNISALUD and students of the National University of Colombia.\n\nMETHODOLOGY: Descriptive longitudinal, prospective and observational study. Follow-up to a cohort without a control group. Modular multi-center stage study. The development of the research is proposed through a modular, multicenter and staged study. For the first phase, all employees of the National University of Colombia (active and retired) who agree to participate in the study will be monitored. The second phase includes monitoring the beneficiaries of UNISALUD affiliates and the third phase includes students and their families. For the calculation of the sample size in phase III, it will be carried out by applying formulas for descriptive studies.\n\nFollow-up Time: It is estimated to be one year from the date of the first dose of the vaccine. A second phase is expected to follow up the outcomes for another additional year.\n\nData collection: It will begin with the presentation of the informed consent for the presentation of the study. Subsequently, a periodic follow-up will be carried out via telephone or email to identify and complete the established sociodemographic, cultural, clinical and pharmacological variables.\n\nSerological Follow-up: The humoral immune response and its duration will be analyzed through serological tests with a blood sample to a sample of the study population. Serological follow-up will be carried out in 3 moments: prior to vaccination, after the first dose of the vaccine, and at the end of the study. The collected samples will be taken to the Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine of the National University of Colombia for their separation. Antibody analysis will be done by chemiluminescence using the Advia Centaur COV2 platform from Siemens (3).\n\nETHICAL ASPECTS: This research is considered a research with minimal risk (Resolution No. 008430 of October 4, 1993 in article 11 of Colombia's Ministry of Healt ). When handling very sensitive information, the informed consent of the user and / or his manager will be filled out, prior to the start of the application of the data collection instrument, and the collection of blood samples for serological monitoring.\n\nAccess to the clinical and pharmacological information of the participants affiliated and beneficiaries of UNISALUD will be required, which will be provided by the same entity, as well as the databases adjusted to the vaccination phases in Colombia. In the case of students, basic contact information and financial situation will be needed, which will be reported by the University Welfare Directorate.\n\nThe treatment of information and data collected in accordance with Law 1266 of 2008 \"Habeas Data\" and subject to acceptance by the participants through informed consent.\n\nThis study protocol has the endorsement of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Sciences in a meeting held on March 1, 2021 (Minutes 02-2021)."

              "BriefSummary":"The investigatores propose to evaluate intravenous administration of convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring hospitalization for symptomatic \"high risk\" COVID19 disease as reflected by the presence of elevated hsTPN. Supportive data exist for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID19 and other overwhelming viral illness. Investigators hypothesize that treatment with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary effects on COVID19 disease severity/duration, with the primary objective to reduce mortality and a key secondary objective to reduce the requirement for and/or duration of mechanical ventilation. Finally, as the hospital mortality for patients requiring mechanical ventilation is very high (50 to 80%), these patients will be eligible for COVID19 CP treatment as well, even in the absence of elevated hsTPN. Although considerable overlap of these populations has been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100% redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP may provide benefit to these critically ill patients.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Coronavirus's are responsible for 15-30% of \"common colds\" and approximately 2% of the population may be healthy carriers of these viruses. The ongoing SARS CoV-2 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China and has spread worldwide. The disease caused by SARS CoV-2 (COVID19) is manifest by fever, fatigue, dry cough, pharyngitis and headache. Although the majority (~80%) COVID19 cases are mild in severity, patients may present with moderate symptoms of dyspnea, tachypnea (~15%) or more severe symptoms (~5-10%) of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, arrythmias and shock(6-9). In addition to the common clinical presentation of respiratory distress, an increasing frequency of cardiovascular manifestations have become evident. These manifestations may be linked to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS CoV-2, which is expressed predominantly in the heart, intestine, kidney and pulmonary alveolar (type 2) cells. Recent data suggest that ~20% of infected subjects may require hospitalization and among patients hospitalized for COVID19, 12-28% will have evidence of myocardial injury (elevated high-sensitivity Troponin: hsTPN) often in association with electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, arrythmias and/or evidence for impaired Left Ventricular contractile function on non-invasive imaging. Indeed, a syndrome of \"pseudo-infarction\" manifest as ST-segment elevation in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease has been described. The etiology(s) of myocardial injury may be multifactorial and includes demand ischemia due to critical illness, cytokine storm with atherosclerotic plaque disruption due to overwhelming systemic inflammation and more likely, myocarditis. Indeed, SARS CoV viral RNA along with macrophage infiltration and myocardial cell injury has been detected in autopsied heart samples from patients who succumbed to the SARS outbreak in Toronto. Further, myocardial injury has been directly correlated with both the degree of systemic inflammation (Level of hsCRP) and cardiac dysfunction (level of NT-proBNP). Importantly, myocardial injury was identified to be one of the two most significant, independent predictors (by multi-variable analysis) of hospital death (in addition to ARDS) and provides increased prognostic information above and beyond that provided by pre-existing co-morbidities including age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Indeed, the incremental risk for death incurred by evidence of myocardial injury appears to be ~5-10x and is amplified by pre-existing cardiovascular disease.\n\nThus, evidence of myocardial injury has evolved to be a significant (if not the most significant) predictor of mortality among patients admitted to hospital for care of COVID19 disease. It is important to recognize that this elevated morality risk has been identified despite modern and aggressive intensive care therapies including mechanical ventilation, pressor/inotrope therapies and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\nIn this context, the investigators propose to evaluate intravenous administration of convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring hospitalization for symptomatic \"high risk\" COVID19 disease as reflected by the presence of elevated hsTPN. Supportive data exist for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID19 and other overwhelming viral illness. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary effects on COVID19 disease severity/duration, with the primary objective to reduce mortality and a key secondary objective to reduce the requirement for and/or duration of mechanical ventilation. Finally, as the hospital mortality for patients requiring mechanical ventilation is very high (50 to 80%), these patients will be eligible for COVID19 CP treatment as well, even in the absence of elevated hsTPN. Although considerable overlap of these populations has been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100% redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP may provide benefit to these critically ill patients.\n\nThis is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label treatment of eligible subjects defined as those who satisfy all inclusion criteria.\n\nEligible subjects will provide written, informed consent prior to participation. A pregnancy test will be obtained on all women of child-bearing potential. Following informed consent, the following baseline laboratory tests will be obtained:\n\nHs-CRP\nD-Dimer\nNT-pro BNP\n\nThese laboratory tests which reflect inflammation, thrombosis and myocardial dysfunction (in addition hsTPN which reflects myocardial necrosis) will be repeated every 2 days during hospitalization. Following baseline assessments and informed consent, eligible enrollees will receive convalescent CoVID-19 plasma by intravenous infusion.\n\nCOVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Study: Convalescent plasma will be obtained from male donors, nulliparous females, or female donors negative for HLA antibodies at least 28 days following recovery from COVID-19 infection. These donors are used to minimize the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Routine ABO and Rh typing and red cell antibody screening will be performed. All plasma will be required to test negative to the following assays per FDA and AABB regulations/ guidelines.\n\nCOVID Convalescent Plasma 500 mls will be administered in intravenously."

              "BriefSummary":"The need for large-scale testing for COVID-19 has been highlighted by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UK government.\n\nImmunity to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection can be determined by detecting the presence of antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Immunoglobulins (Ig) to the SARS-CoV-2 develop during the second and third week of COVID-19 disease and can be detected by analyses conducted using laboratory tests. Accurate and scalable point-of-care testing (POCT) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 immunity would allow community diagnostic to be upscaled enormously. POCT for COVID-19 antibodies is possible using small disposable kits. POCT immunity testing using disposable kits will be imperative for effective surveillance and vaccinations programmes.\n\nThe study aims to test a novel, rapid antibody testing kit (IgG and IgM) in order to confirm its accuracy in a healthy volunteer population. The antibody testing kit intended for use in the study has already been CE marked for this purpose.",
              "DetailedDescription":"This is a commercially funded prospective observational, cohort study of healthy volunteers to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a point of care antibody assay for COVID-19 (the ARIA COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. The test is a disposable lateral flow chromatographic cassette (CTK Biotech, Inc., USA). The kit is CE approved for its intended purpose.\n\n200 healthy volunteers will be enrolled into one of two cohorts:100 who have been confirmed to have had COVID-19 in the past (either by previous positive PCR swab or positive antibody test) and 100 thought not to have been affected by COVID-19. Once they have provided written informed consent to participate, volunteers will be invited to attend a 30 minutes appointment for testing. Prior to testing they will be asked to complete a short questionnaire to collect demographic information and details about previous symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nA finger prick blood sample will be taken from the patient and then tested in the ARIA antibody kit. Afterwards, a routine blood sample (10 ml) will then be taken from the participant. The blood sample will be used in three separate ways:\n\nA small sample of blood will be immediately removed from the sample bottle and placed into an ARIA antibody test kit.\nOne blood tube will be immediately centrifuged and a sample of plasma removed for use in the ARIA antibody testing kit.\nOne tube will be sent to the designated laboratory for formal COVID-19 ELISA antibody testing.\n\nThe ARIA antibody kit will be used to identify the presence of COVID-19 antibodies. The results will be compared to a laboratory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for COVID-19 antibodies. Once samples have arrived at the designated study laboratory they will undergo a specified ELSIA test for COVID-19 antibodies conducted according to the laboratory standard operating procedure for that test. For each sample type analysed (finger prick blood, venous blood, and plasma) the sensitivity and specificity of the test will be calculated against the results of the laboratory ELISA test.\n\nAfterwards a brief exit questionnaire will be completed by the participant to document their experience of the study.\n\nRecruitment is expected to be completed within six months of commencing the study."

              "BriefSummary":"A new coronavirus (COVID-19) highlighted at the end of 2019 in China is spreading across all continents. Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating benign symptoms (such as fever, cough, and headache) to different degrees, COVID-19 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical intrauterine, perpartum or neonatal transmission. Prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women and pregnancy issues are necessary in order to improve knowledge on the subject.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The main objective of this project is to set up a biological and tissue collection in order to study the transplacental passage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, intra uterine fetal death, medical termination of pregnancy or living birth) during COVID-19 pandemic. The biological and tissue collection will be made up of systematic samples taken from parturient women and their pregnancy outcome at the time of their arrival at the maternity unit to deliver whatever their term and pregnancy outcome. This inclusion will concern all pregnant women, both symptomatic and asymptomatic positive COVID-19 women, and negative COVID-19 women. All women included will have a serological test to check their immunity status to SARS-CoV-2 in order to study pregnant women with an unnoticed COVID-19 infection during their pregnancy. The inclusion time will extend from the epidemic period until a year after, in order to document the outcomes of pregnant women potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy. Samples analyses will be carried out after the epidemic peak to not overload laboratories in times of crisis.\n\nThe challenge is to have a better knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological and virological characteristics in particular its involvement in maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality, and to better understand the organs affected and the pathways of contamination within this particular mother-child duo."

Data collected will help describe: 1) risk exposure, 2) knowledge of preventive recommendations, 3) barriers and facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations, 4) barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing when appropriate, and 5) self-care behaviors during COVID-19. Participant inclusion criteria: 1) Self-reported Marshallese; 2) 18 years of age or older; 3) Live in the Continental U.S. or Hawaii.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Background and Rationale\n\nWhile there is much we do not know about the differential effects of COVID-19, early data shows that minority communities are disproportionally effected by the virus. There are many factors that may increase the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 including: 1) community spread because of lack of access to testing in low-income communities, 2) work environments that may increase exposure, 3) more densely populated housing that reduces the ability to social distance, 4) limited understanding of preventive measures due to literacy and language barriers, 5) constrained financial resources to stay home and not work, and/or 6) lack of trust in the health care system. The Marshallese are a Pacific Islander population experiencing significant health disparities with some of the highest documented rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of any population in the world. Estimated T2DM rates among Marshallese in the U.S. range from 25%-50%, much higher than the general U.S. population. People with T2DM are more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications when infected with COVID-19; however, those that manage their T2DM well are less likely to become extremely ill from the virus. In order to reduce the disparities caused by COVID-19 and ultimately compare the effectiveness of prevention interventions among the low-income minority communities most effected by COVID-19, it is critical to understand minority populations': 1) risk exposure, 2) knowledge of preventive recommendations, 3) barriers and facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations, 4) barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing when appropriate, and self-care behaviors during COVID-19.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\nAim 1: Document COVID-19 risk exposure for Marshallese community members.\n\nAim 2: Document Marshallese community members' knowledge of preventive recommendations.\n\nAim 3: Document barriers and facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations.\n\nAim 4: Document Marshallese community members' barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing when appropriate.\n\nAim 5: Document self-care behaviors during COVID-19.\n\nAim 6: Explore COVID-19 pandemic related barriers and facilitators to T2DM self-management among Marshallese adults with T2DM.\n\nAim 7: Assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on T2DM self-management activities among Marshallese adults with T2DM.\n\nStudy Design and Procedures\n\nParticipants will complete an online or telephone survey. Up to 100 participants will also be invited to complete an in-depth qualitative interview in addition to the survey (these results are not presented here). Community-based recruitment for the online survey will be conducted by posting an informational flyer on social media. The flyer will contain a link to the study information sheet and survey documents. Study team members will also reach out to study participants via phone or electronic mediums (e.g. email, text, or messenger). Study staff will send potential participants a link to an electronic survey using REDcap. The REDcap system will include electronic documentation of consent prior to completing the survey. Access to study data will be limited to only those personnel who need it to complete relevant job duties. All data, regardless of whether it is identifiable or not, will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked room, or on a secure University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) server that requires two-factor authentication.Each participant who completes the survey will receive a $20 Walmart gift card as remuneration.\n\nMeasures/outcomes\n\nOur survey will be based on CDC risk assessments and utilize the NIH funded COVID-19 items that are part of the PhenX Toolkit, as well as other standardized survey items/scales. Those participants with T2DM will be asked to complete questions pertaining to T2DM self-management during COVID-19.\n\nData Analysis\n\nGiven the descriptive nature of the study aims, the analytic strategy will focus on presenting results of item-level descriptive analyses, with an emphasis on frequencies and proportions. There will be no attempt to impute missing responses for any items. For each analysis, the number of included responses will be reported."

              "BriefSummary":"Newborns and infants receive passive natural immunity through maternal antibodies present in breastmilk to fight infections caused by viruses such as the COVID-19, until they develop active immunity by illness or vaccination. Such immunity will become the main stay for preventing future waves of COVID-19 epidemics. The high COVID-19 mortality among African Americans is ascribed partly to compromised immune status associated with comorbidity. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is the effective low-cost natural strategy for building immunity right from birth. African Americans record the lowest EBF rates and also lack workplace support. This intervention includes a 10-hour course extracted from 90-hour CLC online program, sufficient to prepare physicians to partner with certified lactation consultant (CLC) to provide their patients comprehensive COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines, training, and support to afford their babies the benefits of breastmilk antibodies, the best line of defense against COVID-19, until availability of safe vaccines. The Breastfeeding Report Card indicates slow improvements in overall breastfeeding rates with persisting disparities. Improving EBF rates can contribute to increased COVID-19 immunity among infants. Preliminary data in Nashville indicates excellent breastfeeding benefit knowledge and intent, but limited training to succeed. Hospital staff encourage breastfeeding but routinely offer formula at birth. Most physicians who provide prenatal care do not actively promote breastfeeding nor routinely offer CLC referral. This single action by physicians can halt routines that compromise successful EBF. The program long-term goal is to prepare obstetricians to actively promote comprehensive breastfeeding among African American mothers. The immediate objective is to develop and evaluate feasibility and effectiveness of an intervention designed to increase COVID-19 breastfeeding guideline adherence and improve EBF skills and rates among African American mothers. The rationale is that mothers who receive physician prenatal encouragement and CLC referral will make confident informed decisions, adopt COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines, safely meet their EBF goals, and provide their infants with appropriate antibodies. The expected outcome is that patient participants will adhere to COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines and record 3-month EBF rate 60 percent or greater.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Phase 1: COVID-19 Breastfeeding Guideline Assessment Survey. 40 mothers who delivered during the period starting from January 1, 2020 to date will be recruited and consented to assess their exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and COVID-19 breastfeeding patterns using a survey designed to be completed by interview on Zoom, phone, or any other social-distancing platform. Information to be collected in this survey will include: demography, medical history, COVID-19 status; COVID-19 breastfeeding guideline action; Stay-home pattern; Breastfeeding frequency and duration; Breastmilk expression frequency/duration; Frequency and volume of feeds with expressed breastmilk or formula.\n\nPhase 2: Intervention Development:\n\nParticipating physicians will attend two 2-hour Zoom sessions, a 4-Module Online Breastfeeding Course, and a 1-hour orientation Zoom session in groups of not more than ten. The following presentations, course, surveys, other materials to be developed:\n\n. Three presentations: i). Introduction: Healthy People 2020 Breastfeeding Objectives, Tennessee breastfeeding statistics, Breastfeeding role of physicians, nurses, and certified lactation consultants (CLC). ii). Breastfeeding Challenges Faced by Mothers. iii). Obstetrician Breastfeeding Promotion Challenges.\n. Online Breastfeeding Promotion 101: A 10-hour course to be developed in partnership with Breastfeeding OUTLOOK, an online continuing education provider.\n. Research Tools: COVID-19 Breastfeeding Guideline Assessment surveys; Pre- and Post-Intervention surveys for physicians; Pre- and Post-Intervention surveys for patients; Consent forms for physicians; Consent and HIPAA forms for patients; Recruitment flyer and Breastfeeding brochure for patients.\n. Moderator Script for Community Engagement to guide the community-patient-provider stakeholder community advisory board (CAB) discussion sessions to review and make recommendations for revision to the following: intervention program, consent forms, surveys, brochure, COVID-19 related guidelines for pregnant and lactating mothers, and strategies to enhance participation. The 12-Person CAB of 4 mothers, 2 nurses/midwives, 2 CLCs, 2 physicians, a virologist, and a community leader. Investigator obstetrician Ladson, G. will be the moderator and the CAB recorder will be investigator Britt, A.\n\nPhase 3: Program Implementation Feasibility and Evaluation:\n\n20 Obstetricians/Physicians will be consented and enrolled to participate as program providers, and expected to complete the following 5 tasks:\n\n. Pre-Intervention Survey: This is 15-minute self-administered pre-test survey to capture breastfeeding promotion knowledge and practices, and COVID-19, other disease, and drug related breastfeeding guidelines.\n. First In-Person Session: 2-hour Zoom session in groups of not more than 10 participants to disseminate Program introduction (20 minutes); Breastfeeding challenges faced by mothers (40 minutes); Obstetrician breastfeeding promotion challenges (40 minutes); Closing session (20 minutes) for Concerns, Q & A.\n. Online Breastfeeding Course 101: Participant physicians will enroll in Breastfeeding OUTLOOK and complete a 10-hour module over a two-week period.\n. Second In-Person Session: 2-hour Zoom session in groups of 10 to provide intervention guidelines, research strategies and skills for participant recruitment, consenting, and survey administration by interview.\n. Intervention Implementation: 20 physicians will each be expected to recruit 10 study participants in the third trimester of pregnancy from their prenatal clients over a period of two months. Physicians will complete a pre-intervention survey at enrollment and post-intervention survey 8 months after enrollment in the program. The physicians will receive intervention protocol, patient HIPPA & consent forms, flyers, and survey booklet after signed consent received by email, and attend a one-hour program orientation in company of an office staff and/or resident physician scheduled in groups of four. The 200 study participants will sign informed consent, complete a pre-intervention patient survey, continue prenatal care, and will be followed up at 1-month and at 3-months postpartum to complete the post-intervention patient survey.\n\nStudy Questionnaires. i) Mother COVID-19 Breastfeeding Guideline Assessment Survey: Demography, medical history, items from Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) & Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) breastfeeding surveys, EBF pattern since January 1, 2020, COVID-19 guideline items, COVID-19 status, Stay-home history.\n\nii) Physician pre-intervention survey: Monthly prenatal volume, breastfeeding knowledge, and practices, CLC referral pattern, COVID-19 and other disease specific EBF guidelines.\n\niii) Physician post-intervention survey: Breastfeeding knowledge and practices, COVID-19 and other disease specific EBF guidelines. Number of participants enrolled and number of CLC referrals.\n\niv) Patient pre-intervention survey: Demography, medical history, CDC & BFHI breastfeeding survey items, physician interaction items, previous CLC encounter, COVID-19 guideline items, COVID-19 status, Stay-home history.\n\nv) Patient post-intervention survey: CLC referral, CLC appointment and breastfeeding class attendance; COVID-19 guideline adherence; EBF initiation, frequency/duration of EBF; frequency and duration of breastmilk expression (manual or pump); frequency and volume of formula or breastmilk feeds. Infant feeding and growth pattern from medical records and growth charts. COVID-19 serology test (optional)."

              "BriefSummary":"This study seeks to evaluate how secondary data retrieved from remote physiological monitoring performed during routine outpatient/at-home care periods can allow for the discovery of novel physiomarkers that predict acute deterioration or hospitalization among people testing positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).",
              "DetailedDescription":"Most recent research publications and clinical trials have exclusively focused on the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) care of COVID-19 patients. Few have focused on how to direct care delivered at home, where the majority of coronavirus infected will recover, and how and when to rescue those who are at immediate risk for poor outcomes. To standardize the home monitoring process and offer guidance in this uncharted territory, the researchers have created a method for outpatient management of COVID-19 patients and high suspicion influenza-like illness (ILI) for Emory University Hospital. This includes the newly implemented model of clinics including in-person ambulatory management in the Acute Respiratory Clinic (ARC), the Virtual Outpatient Management Clinic (VOMC), and the Emory COVID-19 Outpatient Remote Monitoring Registry (E-CORMR). Initial analysis of the management system, particularly in risk tier assignment, has shown that assigning risk tiers early can help to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration. The researchers have also demonstrated symptom profiles and durations of the \"typical\" outpatient disease course. The E-CORMR was used to create a dashboard for improved management of these frequently complex patients. It was determined after its creation that it could also be used for research purposes to store data collected from physiologic parameters.\n\nThe goal of this study is to develop algorithms using secondary data abstracted from remote monitoring devices that were collected within the E-CORMR. The researchers propose to derive robust algorithms through the analysis of that data that identify a potential hospitalization. The findings will not only improve the management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 but also provide information that allows early intervention on patients at risk of decompensation. This information can then be used by other healthcare systems to care for patients more safely at home, thus reducing the impact of COVID-19 on overburdened acute care settings and preventing poor outcomes."

              "BriefSummary":"This study will assess the feasibility and safety of administering multiple doses of convalescent plasma to Covid-19 positive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) receiving mechanical ventilation. Donor plasma will be obtained from Covid-19 recovered patients. All plasma used in this protocol will be collected following the guidelines issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Ministry of Health in Panama.\n\nEvery patient recruited will receive one or two plasma units infused on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. The primary objective of this study is feasibility. Feasibility will be assessed based on the proportion of subjects who consent and receive at least one dose of convalescent plasma more than once. The investigators will evaluate the safety and feasibility of this study by accounting for any related adverse event.\n\nThe secondary study endpoints are overall survival at days 14, 28, and 60 after the first dose of convalescent plasma. Respiratory status and overall clinical status will be reviewed during follow-up until day nine and on days 14, 28, and 60.",
              "DetailedDescription":"From historical and anecdotal data on convalescent plasma, it seems its administration is safe in cases of coronavirus infection. Now, the high mortality of COVID-19, particularly in elderly and vulnerable persons such as critically ill patients, suggests that the benefits of its use in those at high risk for death outweigh the risks. However, for all cases where convalescent plasma administration is considered, a risk-benefit assessment must be conducted to assess individual variables.\n\nThis study proposed the follow-up of 30 intubated patients due to COVID-19 who have been admitted to the ICU and have consented to receive five doses of one or two units of convalescent plasma.\n\nEvery patient will have a follow-up from the consent day to day 60. The study team will monitor and record: vital signs, daily ventilatory requirements, and assessment of clinical status, including new medical conditions and adverse events."

Participants will be randomized to receive either the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine or the Pnemoccocal Prevnar-13 vaccine at baseline after bloodwork is drawn. Another blood sample will be taken 28 days later. After completion of the study, participants in the control group (pneumococcal Prevnar-13 vaccine) will be given a fourth dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and will have their blood drawn 28 days post-vaccination."

              "BriefSummary":"SAR-Cov-2 infection and its clinical manifestation known as COVID-19 beside the respiratory and lung involvement may include the cardiovascular system, the nervous system and the liver. In the acute phase of the disease, all of these conditions may be life-threatened. As a result, after the acute phase of COVID-19, early complications may be observed, including heart, lungs, brain, muscles and liver. A few papers to date have been reported of myocarditis, ventricular arrhythmias, post-inflammatory changes in the lung and liver, as well as ischemic changes in the brain, diseases of skeletal muscle, which may have adverse prognostic effects. Due to the extent of the pandemic, the severity of the complications and the expected high complications' prevalence in the early post-recovery period, a study was designed to determine the extent of the problem of early complications after COVID-19. Complex cardiological, pulmonary, neurological and hepatological diagnostics are planned, including laboratory, imaging and functional tests. The results obtained, in addition to determining the scale of the problem, will allow the selection of studies that optimally identify patients with early complications. The purpose of this procedure is to enable rapid treatment of diseases that are complications of SARS-COV-2 infection. An additional aspect raised in the project will be the issue of psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression, post traumatic disorders).\n\nThe main three purposes of the study include:\n\nthe assessment of prevalence of particular complications after COVID-19.\nidentification of the demographic and clinical risk factors of COVID-19 complications\ndetermining the diagnostic tests which are sufficient to detect early complications of COVID-19"

              "BriefSummary":"Background Recent studies indicate that a 2nd booster dose is associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19. The studies are based on Israeli registry data, comparing outcomes among individuals who have taken the booster, or not. Interpreting the findings from such non-experimental studies is challenging - there are likely systematic differences between those who accept the offer to take a booster dose, and those who do not.\n\nAim Determine the effect of offering vaccination with a 2nd COVID-19 booster dose on severe COVID-19, measured by hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19.\n\nMethods Intervention group: A random sample drawn from the whole population aged 45-64 years with 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine will receive a personal offer to receive the 4th dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in their municipality.\n\nControl group: The rest of the population aged 45-64 with 3 doses, who will receive no such offer.\n\nRandomization: The investigators will draw a set of birth dates - can then see who is in the intervention group in Beredt C19 (Norwegian emergency preparedness register for COVID-19) without identifying them individually (personal identification numbers are encrypted).\n\nPrimary outcome: Hospitalization or death caused by COVID-19 in a period of 10 weeks after invitations are sent.\n\nSample size calculations: 300 000 individuals in the intervention group, assuming risk of the primary outcome is at least 15% lower in the intervention group. (The investigators expect a large proportion NOT to accept the invitation to take the vaccine).",
              "DetailedDescription":"Background and rationale\n\nSeveral studies suggest a waning of COVID-19 vaccines' effectiveness over time, raising the question of whether booster doses should be offered to maintain protection against severe COVID-19.\n\nStudies of the effectiveness of taking one booster dose, which for most people corresponds to a third vaccine dose, have shown promising results. Similarly, three recent studies examining the effectiveness of a 2nd booster dose found that the 2nd booster was associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19. All these studies are based on data from Israeli registries, comparing outcomes among individuals who have taken the booster, or not. Interpreting the findings from such non-experimental studies is challenging since there are likely systematic differences between those who accept the offer to take a booster dose, and those who do not. So called \"healthy vaccinee bias\" implies that those who take the vaccine are healthier than those not taking the vaccine. The opposite, however, may also be true: Those who perceive themselves to be more at risk may be more prone to accept the offer of vaccination. A related type of bias is the \"premature efficacy bias\" which is observed in many observational studies within one to two weeks after vaccination, probably due to people refraining from taking the vaccine if they suspect that they have already been infected. Comorbidities or socio-economic factors that are not adequately controlled for can also lead to biased results. The conventional approach to minimizing the risk of bias in effectiveness studies is to conduct a randomized trial - if feasible.\n\nThe future of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. In Norway, a large winter wave driven by the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is receding after more than half the population has been infected. The vaccination coverage in the Norwegian population is also very high.\n\nIn the autumn of 2022, a new wave of infections may start due to waning immunity, and/or the emergence of a new variant.\n\nEither way, vaccination will be the most important tool to reduce the risk of severe disease in individuals. Based on previous experiences and the available data, it is likely that health authorities in Norway (and probably other European countries) will offer or even recommend a 2nd booster dose (the fourth dose) to those who are aged 65 years and above. For those who are younger and therefore at lower risk of severe COVID-19, the value of a 2nd booster is less clear, making it difficult to decide for or against offering a 2nd booster to this group.\n\nThe investigators therefore propose to conduct a register-based randomized trial (RRCT) to provide evidence for the effects of offering a 2nd booster (a fourth dose) in the age group 45-64 years.\n\nObjectives Our primary objective is to determine the effect of offering vaccination with a COVID-19 booster dose on severe COVID-19, measured by hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19.\n\nOur secondary objective is to determine the effects (intended and unintended) of offering vaccination with a COVID-19 booster dose on the use of health care services, prescription medication related to COVID-19, and on SARS-CoV-2 infection rate.\n\nTrial design The trial is designed as a register-based randomized trial. The investigators will draw a random sample from the whole population aged 45-64 years, which will constitute the intervention group and will receive a personal offer to receive a 2nd booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in their municipality. The rest of the population aged 45-64 will receive no such offer or information and will serve as control group. The random sample will be defined by drawing a set of birth dates. This allows the investigators to identify persons in the intervention group directly in the Norwegian Preparedness Register for COVID-19 without identifying them individually, since personal identification numbers are encrypted in this database. The random sample will receive the offer of vaccination either (i) via Helsenorge (National online health services in Norway) through a survey tool available to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, or (ii) directly from their municipality (to be determined)."

There is still much that is unknown regarding the virus, especially its effects on pregnancy, the fetus, and the neonate. This study seeks to evaluate adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes related to COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe FDA has authorized emergency use authorization for the SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. Pregnant women were excluded from the Phase III clinical trials of the mRNA vaccines. There are no studies that have evaluated functional antibody responses, antibody reactivity to variant viruses, T cell frequencies or activity, or protection against infection or development of COVID-19. Having a more detailed understanding of how pregnancy and lactation alters the longevity, specificity, and activity of antiviral antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is essential for the FDA to inform future recommendations and regulation of these vaccines."

              "BriefSummary":"A brisk immune response can clear a pathogen but can cause extensive collateral damage to the host. It is known that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection triggers a multi system inflammatory disorder which can lead to a spectrum of clinical symptoms (Dhama et al. 2020). Severely ill patients maintain a sustained profile of high pro-inflammatory cytokines, (Lucas et al. 2020). Approximately 20% of patients display acute multi-system failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), accompanied by an intense inflammatory process, which is life-threatening (Wang et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020). However, in severe COVID-19, the lymphocyte count decreases progressively, while the neutrophil count gradually increases (Li et al. 2020). To date, four meta-analyses have reported that patients with severe COVID-19 infection have a higher Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) than those with non-severe COVID-19 infection (Zheng et al. 2020, Chan & Rout. 2020; Ghahramani et al. 2020; Lagunas-Rangel et al. 2020). There is no absolute reported objective threshold level for when NLR progresses from near normal through moderate to severe. An objective marker of cellular dysfunction of neutrophils would be a helpful tool for the clinician in monitoring changes to the patient status and to determine if interventions are having positive effect.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Detailed Description:\n\nIt is known that COVID-19 infection triggers a multi system inflammatory disorder which can lead to a spectrum of clinical symptoms (Dhama et al. 2020). Approximately 20% of patients display acute multi-system failure, including ARDS, accompanied by an intense inflammatory process, which is life-threatening (Wang et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020). However, in severe COVID-19, the lymphocyte count decreases progressively, while the neutrophil count gradually increases (Li et al. 2020). To date, four meta-analyses have reported that patients with severe COVID-19 infection have a higher NLR than those with non-severe COVID-19 infection (Zheng et al. 2020, Chan & Rout. 2020; Ghahramani et al. 2020; Lagunas-Rangel et al. 2020). There is no absolute reported objective threshold level for when NLR progresses from near normal through moderate to severe.\n\nNeutrophils operate using a number of different mechanisms including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and granular proteins and the production and liberation of cytokines (Selder et al. 2017; Hellebrekers et al. 2018). Neutrophils are subjected to complex environmental regulation and this can result in significant differences in the production of ROS (Panday et al. 2015 and Nguyen et al. 2017). Veenith and et all have previously demonstrated that ROS production in COVID-19 is dysfunctional (Veenith et al 2022, publishing process). Despite the immense number of studies providing evidence of a dysregulated in vivo innate immune response in some COVID-19 patients, it became apparent that measurement of retained functional capacity of leukocytes (primarily neutrophils) to produce ROS in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) in whole blood samples could provide a rapid 10-minute detection method for objectively determining onset or occurrence of severe COVID-19 and monitoring progression and treatment of COVID-19. A predictive mathematical model would aid the early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and allow clinicians to prioritise patients. Therefore the analysis of the ROS production in response to PMA in COVID-19 pneumonia comparison with healthy subjects may reveal this hypothesis.\n\nMethod:\n\nThe study was conducted with ethical committee approval in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Hospital The patient population consisted of patients who were admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 pneumonia; the healthy volunteer population consisted of healthcare workers from the hospital. Analysis was performed on clinical samples or via finger-prick assay from healthy volunteers. ROS production in response to PMA was analysed within 30 minutes of collection. Diagnosis of COVID status was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Together with a range of conventional haematological tests and clinical observations, the LIT test was performed every day or every other day until death or discharge from the ICU.\n\nData collection:\n\nPatients were followed from their admission to ICU up to the day of exitus or ICU discharge. All data were prospectively collected on standardized study forms. Data variables collected on admission included the demographic characteristics, diagnosis, comorbidities, date of PCR test positivity, symptoms of COVID-19, severity of COVID-19 (according to world health organisation (WHO) classification), type of treatment, use of ventilation and ventilation type, partial arterial oxygen pressure/inspired oxygen fraction (PaO2/FiO2) ratio , use of antibiotics, C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, total leukocyte count. On admission, severity of the patient was evaluated with APACHE II and severity of organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. During ICU stay, patients were assessed for the development of sepsis or septic shock. The vital signs on the day of LIT test was performed were also recorded. The Intensive care unit outcome parameters such as duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, length of hospitalization and mortality were also evaluated. The CRP, neutrophil count and total leukocyte count were performed on the day of LIT test was performed of the healthy volunteers.\n\nMeasurements of ROS production by luminometer:\n\nROS production was measured according to the method previously described [25-27]. Briefly, 10μl samples of freshly obtained blood (obtained by finger prick or venepuncture) was added to 100 microlitres phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) and luminol. The solution was incubated for 10 minutes at 37.5 °C. Chemiluminescence was quantified after 10 minutes using 3MTM handheld luminometer (Clean-Trace, NG3) in relative light units (RLU) . LIT scores as a correlate of neutrophil function for each patient (sampled every day or every other day) and each healthy volunteer (sampled only once) were plotted.\n\nAbnormally high (hyperproduction) or low (hypoproduction) ROS generation was associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This raises the possibility of LIT™/neutrophil-count ratio, (LIT/N), being used as a predictive clinical tool."

A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. (1) Fang et al. has suggested that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression. (2) In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) (3) Moreover, Wu et al, demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening. (4) In addition, isotretinoin was reported to increase CD4 counts and markedly decrease viremia in HIV positive patients suffering from acne vulgaris. (5) Currently, a study is running to evaluate the effect of isotretinoin on immune activation among HIV-1 infected subjects with incomplete CD4+ T cell recovery. (6) From this point, we can suggest that patient taking isotretinoin therapy may be immune against SARS-COV-2 and it can also have a therapeutic effect by prevention of further progression of the virus. Several potential mechanisms of action of Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 have been postulated and they are actually used in treatment regimens for COVID-19.(7) It was reported that chloroquine increase the blood level of isotretinoin, so lower doses is required when combined. We assume to test the efficacy of isotretinoin in treatment of COVID-19 versus combined therapy with the standard treatment of COVID-19.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase III trial. The duration of the trial for each subject is expected to be 3 months. The duration for each individual subject includes one-month study treatment and 3 months follow-up time.

              "BriefSummary":"The objective of this research is to use a localized mHealth intervention to boost COVID-19 testing and vaccine literacy, access, and uptake among women with CLSI",
              "DetailedDescription":"Based on our prior work with CLSI women, mHealth strategies are an excellent way to keep in touch and push just-in-time content. During the pandemic, we were forced to close field sites and stop any in-person follow-up visits. Even prior to the pandemic, telephone follow-up surveys were conducted with 60% of participants. Post-pandemic, we conducted 95% of those surveys over the phone, with the remaining over email or mail correspondence. Most participants use text messaging regularly and can access the Web on their phones. Our ongoing RCT (N=73 participants completed) of an mHealth intervention on women's health shows this modality is feasible for delivering information and engaging participants. Specifically, we found that 81% of women who initiate can complete the intervention. The average time for completion of one module, for example on sexually transmitted infections, took 19 minutes, whereas cervical cancer took 13 minutes to complete. We estimate the proposed module on COVID-19 testing and vaccine will take on average between 15 to 20 minutes to complete. This time for intervention completion, combined with text message information about any new COVID-19 mitigation news (e.g., boosters, vaccine for children, new testing recommendations, testing locations, etc.), should result in about 30-60 minutes of total formal engagement during the study.\n\nWhat we propose will be brief, but targeted messaging intervention from verified sources, delivered in an adequate lay language and using spokespersons that are relatable and familiar, and can be trusted, has been proven effective in changing targeted behaviors.32,33 Our intervention design also draws on lessons learned from evidence-based interventions to improve vaccination uptake among adults, for example a meta-analysis conducted in 2021 on public response to health messages encouraging vaccination.34 Our mHealth intervention allows participants to attend to the information at their own pace, while ensuring that they are prompted to complete the module. To avoid unidirectionality and promote engagement, they will be able to use an asynchronous messaging component to ask questions and receive answers from the research team. There is no question that such an intervention is necessary for a population with likely low uptake of both testing and vaccination, especially when that population is not the explicit target of most public health messaging. To the critique of whether the intervention is sufficient, we don't know. We hypothesize that the intervention will be effective at boosting COVID-19 testing and vaccine literacy, access, and uptake, and the goal of this study is to test that hypothesis. One advantage of this approach is the ability for nimbleness, that is, being able to adapt in real-time to new information about the pandemic and being able to push that new information out to women using the proposed intervention platform. Another unique advantage is the scalability of such an intervention, and its ability to be made widely available to all CLSI women in the United States"

              "DetailedDescription":"Patients on dialysis are at risk for several infectious diseases, since they have reduced immunological and have to regularly attend dialysis centres from once to thrice a week depending on their residual renal function even if a pandemic is going on.\n\nDialysis patients and healthcare professionals of dialysis centres can become infected one with the other.\n\nThe incident risk of COVID-19 in dialysis centres is still unknown. Given the challenges of an early diagnosis of COVID-19, the likely transmission with outbreaks, the possibility of reciprocal transmission of the infection among patients and healthcare professionals, the frequent clinical severity of COVID-19 in dialysis patients because of the coexistence of several comorbidities, CONTACT TRACING could be an effective and efficient tool to contrast COVID-19 spreading in dialysis centres. This modality keeps trace of the contacts the new COVID-19 case have had and allow the identification of other possible cases in that outbreak\n\nContact tracing is the key tool to detect and trace COVID-19 cases among patients and health care professionals, i.e. the space-time mapping of the contacts among these two categories:\n\nDaily for healthcare professionals\nAt every dialysis session for haemodialysis patients\nAt every hospital visit for patients on peritoneal dialysis\n\nMaximum follow will be up to 12 months excepting in those patients who develop a COVID-19-related clinically significant event:\n\nDiagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 with or without hospitalisation\nRespiratory insufficiency with the need of CPAP or mechanical ventilation\nDeath associated or related to COVID-19\n\nIn the participating centres, the enrolment of patients and healthcare professionals will be prospective, progressive and competitive till the number of cases of COVD-19 will reach 200 subjects. If study participation will be 10% and COVID-19 will be taken by 4% of the patients with no prior exposure to COVID-19, we can estimate to enrol 5000 subjects (dialysis patients and healthcare professionals) over a period of 12 months in 50-150 centres. The length of the enrolment period of 6-12 months will depend also on future evolution of the pandemic in the Italian regions that have not been massively hit by the infection.\n\nStudy data will be stored on a web-database, which will be created on purpose. Privacy protection of patients and health care professionals will be pursued and granted by anonymous data collection.\n\nGiven the longitudinal and prospective design of the study, Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to describe the incidence of COVID-19 infection and the survival of dialysis patients and their healthcare professionals.\n\nCox multivariate analysis will be used to:\n\nEstimate the incidence, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in the two categories\nEstimate predictors and/or confounders associated with the incidence of the three study outcomes (infection, morbidity and mortality)"
