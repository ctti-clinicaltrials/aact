          "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well tailoring therapy in post-surgery works in patients with low-risk endometrial cancer. The usual approach for patients with low-risk endometrial cancer is treatment with surgery. In this study, tissue that is removed as part of the surgical procedure is analyzed in the pathology laboratory to help guide the doctor to decide whether or not additional treatment such as radiation and or chemotherapy should be recommended.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Estimate the rate of pelvic recurrence at 3 years in patients who are treated with a de-escalated adjuvant treatment directed by tumour molecular status.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the rate of isolated vaginal recurrence, para-aortic recurrence and distant metastasis at 3 years.\n\nII. Estimate the recurrence-free, endometrial cancer-specific and overall survival.\n\nIII. Describe the impact of molecular classification on patient decisional conflict and fear of recurrence.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate health economic impact of molecular classification-tailored adjuvant therapy on the cost of treating endometrial cancer.\n\nII. Evaluate quality of life. III. Determine if variability in adjuvant treatment given to patients with endometrial cancer is decreased by molecular classification-tailored adjuvant therapy as compared to recent clinical practice data.\n\nIV. To assess if additional molecular parameters can further refine prognosis within POLE-mutated and p53wt/no specific molecular profile (NSMP) endometrial cancer (EC).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 sub-studies.\n\nSUB-STUDY A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT A1: Patients with POLE-mutated early-stage EC undergo observation on study.\n\nCOHORT A2: Patients with higher-risk POLE-mutated EC undergo observation or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and/or vaginal brachytherapy over 3-5 fractions.\n\nSUB-STUDY B: Patients with p53 wildtype/NSMP ER+ EC undergo observation or vaginal brachytherapy over 3-5 fractions.\n\nAll patients undergo chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans during screening and as clinically indicated throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then every year."

Lymph node dissection can be performed as per institutional standards (sentinel or full lymphadenectomy). There must be no macroscopic residual disease after surgery\n* Patients must have histologically confirmed stage I to III endometrial carcinoma which can be endometrioid, serous, clear cell, un/dedifferentiated, carcinosarcoma or mixed\n* Patients' Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0, 1, or 2\n* Patients' age must be \\>= 18 years\n* Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate. A similar process must be followed for sites outside of Canada as per their respective cooperative group's procedures\n* Patient is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires in either English, French or a validated language. The baseline assessment must be completed within required timelines, prior to enrollment. Inability (lack of comprehension in English or French, or other equivalent reason such as cognitive issues or lack of competency) to complete the questionnaires will not make the patient ineligible for the study. However, ability but unwillingness to complete the questionnaires will make the patient ineligible\n* Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients enrolled on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits placed on patients being considered for this trial. The patient's city of residence may be required to verify their geographical proximity. (Call the CCTG office (613-533-6430) if questions arise regarding the interpretation of this criterion.) Investigators must assure themselves the patients enrolled on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up\n* Patients must agree to return to their primary care facility for any adverse events which may occur through the course of the trial\n* Protocol treatment is to begin within 10 weeks of hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n* SUB-STUDY A: Patients with endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid, serous, clear cell, un-/dedifferentiated, carcinosarcoma, mixed), must have one of the following combinations of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, grade, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI):\n\n  * Cohort A1:\n\n    * Stage IA (not confined to polyp), grade 3, pN0, with or without LVI (Pelvic lymph node surgical assessment (sentinel or full lymphadenectomy) is required for grade 3 or stage II.
